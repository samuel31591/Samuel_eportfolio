                          </p>
                          <p>It has been observed that the pace of technological advancement in the medical industry is faster than the pace 
                          of cyber security considerations (Glisson et al., 2015). The critical observation is that a breach of a training
                          tool would result in a clinician receiving incorrect guidance when problem-solving is insightful. A discrepancy
                          between technology and security considerations in this industry can potentially result in a fatality.</p> 
                          
                          <p>The studies were conducted on a mannequin model (istan), a wireless patient simulator used at the university's College
                          of Nursing. The device can bleed, secrete bodily fluids, has blood pressure and heart rate, and breathes realistically. 
                          The simulator links with iStan software, which controls the mannequin remotely (Still, 2015). By identifying the network 
                          security solution and network protocol as the vulnerable components, brute-force attacks against the router PIN, as well
                          as denial-of-service attacks using open-source tools such as Backtrack</p>
                          
                          <p>The tools implemented in this experiment were not sophisticated or difficult to acquire. However, this alone highlights the
                          lack of security currently being implemented in these devices.</p>
                          
                          <p>A brute force attack that targeted the Wi-Fi and a denial-of-service attack rendering the unit inoperable were used to 
                          demonstrate the vulnerability of the medical
                          mannequin. A Denial of service (DOS) attack is designed to shut down or make the target unusable. This is accomplished 
                          by flooding the target with a large amount of data that the device cannot handle, causing it to become unresponsive.</p>
                          
                          <p>There are several ways to mitigate brute force attacks, such as changing passwords frequently, increasing password length,
                          limiting login attempts, and
                          implementing multifactor authentication. A proactive approach would be setting up alerts for brute force attacks and 
                          monitoring and stopping them before they
                          are fully deployed (Varonis, 2021).</p>
                          
                          <p>DOS attacks can be prevented by proactively monitoring a system for any unusual activity by creating a baseline. In addition 
                          to this monitoring, an effective method could also be to implement a VPN with MFA required to access the medical device 
                          (Phoenixnapp,2018). Over the years, medical devices have gone from being utterly non-connected to being both wirelessly
                          and software controlled. It's worth bearing in mind that there is an international standard to which medical devices must
                          certify; The IEC 62304 Medical device software, which was put in place to prevent cyber-criminal events on medical devices. 
                          However, the standard has not been updated to consider and include either network connectivity or cybersecurity
                          (Williams, Woolward, 2015). When medical device manufacturers are required by law to implement strict security measures
                          into the lifecycle of their products, we will likely see the threats above, and vulnerabilities decrease.</p>

                        <h4> Hi Isioma</h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>As rightly pointed out Isioma, medical systems are also considered IoT systems. IoT, while influential and beneficial, introduces
                          several security issues. IoT's key risks include network vulnerabilities and outdated software and firmware (Shea, 2021). 
                          they often are produced with Weak or hardcoded passwords. By default, attackers may already know the device's password.
                          Usually, passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot be changed, and are vulnerable to credential theft.
                          One notable example of such an attack is Mirai malware. The Lack of an update process or mechanism.</p>
                          
                          <p>Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and connectivity. Unfortunately, when
                          hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or bugs, they become vulnerable even if they are secure at purchase. Over time,
                          IoT devices become exposed if regular updates are not applied (Thales, 2021).</p>
                          
                          <p>In addition to the mitigative measures, you have already stated in this discussion. To mitigate the risks associated with this
                          device, manufacturers of the mannequin should consider policies such as password complexity, password expiration, account 
                          lockout, and one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when setting up the device.</p>
                          
                          <p>Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the likelihood of IoT attacks. Only signed
                          updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for authenticity when applying updates 
                          (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>By disabling WPS, the mannequin can't easily connect to the network, making it more vulnerable. 
                          The WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a wireless network security standard that makes connections 
                          between a router and wireless devices (mannequins) faster and easier. Wireless Protected Setup 
                          is a key exchange mechanism rather than a security mechanism. It facilitates connections between
                          devices and access points and is one of the vulnerable points of a network.</p> 
                          <p>WPS works with WPA/WPA2/PSK and allows devices to establish connections to WLANs. Utilizing the 
                          following methods</p>  
                          <li><p>PIN: Entering a PIN on the device</p></li>
                          <li><p>Push-button: A physical or virtual push-button should be pressed on both the access point and the
                          client device during the connection phase.</p></li>
                          <li><p>NFC: To use Near Field Communication, the client must bring their device close to the access point.</p></li>
                            <li><p>USB drive:  Necessary connection information exchange between an access point and a device is done
                          using a USB drive.</p></li>
                          <p>The short length of WPS PINs and the fact that both PIN parts are validated separately means that an
                          online brute force attack on the PIN can be made within several hours, allowing an attacker to access
                          a WLAN (mannequin device).
                          Wireless LAN clients can authenticate their users and ensure user confidentiality through WPA or WPA2.
                          WPA is vulnerable to the offline dictionary attack since the information required to create and verify
                          a session key is broadcasted (Noureddine
                          Boudriga, 2019, p.270) Using WPA2/enterprise security and mutual client and server authentication 
                          provides the most secure and protected wireless network compared to the WPA and WEP.

                          <p>The unit learning outcome was to learn more about the threats/risks and vulnerabilities; this task
                            has helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed 
                            researching ways to mitigate the vulnerabilities discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin
                            vulnerabilities. I think the task has allowed me to improve my research and information synthesis 
                            skills, also listed as one of the learning outcomes. 
                            The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork, which 
                            is quite interesting to collaborate with other peers to achieve a common goal.
                            We were to complete the Team Contract. We did this with utmost simplicity and came up with our team leader.

                            and writing the peer responses because it encouraged me to research more on the points 
                            mentioned by my peers, so I was able to make my case. It has also further developed my skills 
                            in being able to collect information and collating it, which is one of my learning goals.
                            The preparation for Seminar 1 was also interesting since I could apply the knowledge gained in 
                            the lecture on the DREAD risk analysis method to an actual real-life scenario. DREAD is a proper
                            risk analysis tool to introduce the students to as it is not complicated, and it quickly 
                            demonstrates the risk analysis objectives without overcomplicating them. The trickiest part 
                            of this assignment was the teamwork. We agreed on a strategy, and it was a success.

                                that there are 12 hops
                                from my laptop to the website. Shown below in the Pic

                                that delay? It was observed
                                that the 6th step caused the biggest delay with the request time out
                              </p>
                              <p>3. What are the main nameservers for the website? I used an open-source to find out the
                                nameservers for the website.
                                https://whois.domaintools.com/ ; as shown in the pic1 & 2 below, there are four name

                                the DNS record, the IP address as 68.66.247.187

                              <p>6. Where is the website hosted? To find out where the website is hosted, I used
                                Geolocation, since I have obtained
                                the IP address from the MX lookup and was able to see that its hosting ISP is in the
                                United States of America in ANN Arbor city.

                            <p>Security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is an ongoing problem. In today's
                              hyper-connected world, security attacks are a reality. Beran points out that
                              a recent Deloitte (2018) report projects that nearly 70% of medical devices 
                              will be connected to networks by 2025 (Necat, 2022). Health care products are
                              becoming increasingly connected, and cyber-attacks are becoming more powerful
                              and ingenious, so the threat of cyber-attacks is escalating dramatically. The 
                              stakes are high, from revenue losses to product recalls to patient safety and
                              brand damage; or worse, a regulatory body could shut down business operations.
                              In addition, there are the "unknown risks"--cyber vulnerabilities that are 
                              ignored due to insufficient forethought or expertise.</p>
                              
                              <p>According to Isioma (Okafor Tolofari, 2022), human factors contribute to cybersecurity
                              breaches. The IoT device like the mannequin can be exploited because of various factors,

                              implementation of security in the production of these medical devices that are connected 
                              to the network from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides guidance to help 
                              medical devices manufacturers design and maintain products that are cyber secured  in 
                              the USA, to the computer misuse Act of 1990, which acknowledged that it is an offence 
                              to cause a computer to perform any function with the intent to secure unauthorized access
                              to any program or data in England and Wales (Jubet,2022)
                              
                              <p>My initial post described the IEC 62304 regulation on functional safety, which covers software
                              design and maintenance. This regulation describes processes, activities, and tasks to ensure
                              software safety. In medical device software development and maintenance, the software is itself
                              a medical device.</p>
                              
                              <p>There are many security recommendations for IoT devices, including biometrics and two-factor 
                              authorization, but blockchain-based IoT security might be the best solution for the largely
                              unregulated IoT market. IoT security may be enhanced by blockchain, which is most famous 
                              for bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain technology provides strong protection against data 
                              tampering, limiting access to the Internet of Things devices, and removing compromised devices
                              from an IoT network.</p>
                              
                              <p>Regulations related to the use and development of IoT will continue to evolve as they advance. 
                              IoT security system on the blockchain is, however, something that seems very promising.</p>

                          <p>In Unit 3, we scanned the website assigned to our group and discussed the results.
                            We also had to submit our final post on medical mannequin vulnerabilities and prepared 
                            for the seminar for next week on TCP/IP and ISO/OSI 7 layer internet protocols.
                            The article on Medical Mannequins (Glisson, 2015) has given me a clear idea of what I 
                            wanted to say in my final discussion forum post. Peer contributions helped to clarified some 
                            points that I had initially misunderstood.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the 3-week 
                            discussion has improved my ability to locate relevant information security information 
                            from various sources.
                            Conversely, I found the individual scans we had to do on the website assigned to us
                            more challenging. Since I have no experience with the command prompt, 
                            I have enjoyed preparing for the next seminar in Unit 4. The article we 
                            had to read has showcased the other side of information technology and demonstrated how
                            the very early applications of the Agile method helped TCP/IP network protocol become 
                            the leading one over the ISO/OSI protocol.</p>
                            <p> we were able to achieve our unit learning goals of expressing
                            basic network concepts and performing basic network troubleshooting throughout the tasks
                            we had this week.

                            <p>Both models have advantages and disadvantages. The OSI model should be preferred over the
                              TCP/IP approach if appropriate documentation, specification, and modularisation are 
                              essential. However, if the network's implementation, stability, and security are more 
                              critical, the TCP/IP model should be implemented</p>

                               with the OSI model having7 layers while the TCP/IP has five layers.</p> 
                              <p>3.Each layer provides different functionalities in the network.</p>  
                              <p>4.Protocols: Both the OSI and the TCP/IP model use different protocols in different layers 
                              for the proper implementation of the model over the network.</p> 
                              <p>5.Functionalities: The OSI and the TCP/IP model layers provide approximately the same functionality.</p>

                              <h4><b>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OSI AND THE TCP/IP MODEL</b></h4>
                              </p>
                              
                              
                              <p>1.Evolution: The OSI model evolved as a logical and conceptual model. The TCP/IP model is
                              implemented first with the specified protocols and then documented. So, if someone needs
                              the theoretical aspects of the model, they should go with the OSI model. But if someone 
                              wants to implement the model practically - use the TCP-IP model.</p>
                              <p>2.Objective: The OSI model's goal is to create a generic standard for describing connection
                              methods, layered architecture, services, interfaces, and protocols. The TCP/IP model, on 
                              the other hand, strives to provide a secure and end-to-end transmission model. The OSI 
                              model should be used if a generic and standard model is required. However, the TCP/IP 
                              paradigm should be chosen if network stability and security are needed.</p>
                              <p>3.Area Focused: The OSI model is a generic model that is hence universal. It can be 
                              utilised in various sorts of networks according to the standards. The TCP/IP model, on
                              the other hand, is protocol-based and compatible with existing Internet architecture.
                              The OSI Model should be used if someone needs a universal model that can be applied to
                              various networks.</p>
                              <p>4.Documentation: The OSI model specifies the three central concepts of services, interfaces,
                              and protocols. The TCP/IP model is not so clear. So, if someone needs documentation and 
                              guidance while implementing the network, they should refer to the OSI model.</p>
                              <p>5.Set-up and Configuration: The OSI model is simple to set up and configure because it 
                              is a generic model. The TCP/IP approach, on the other hand, is complicated since it is 
                              only compatible with certain types of networks. So, the OSI model is superior when it 
                              comes to network setup and configuration.</p>
                              <p>6.Modularity: If someone focuses on a more modular network with proper functionalities,
                              they should go for the TCP/IP model. Both models are modular, but the OSI model has 
                              more layers (7) than the TCP-IP model(5 layers).</p>
                              <p>7.Replacing Protocols: The OSI model is a protocol-independent model which allows us 
                              to implement our protocols as per our needs. On the other hand, the TCP/IP model is 
                              protocol dependent and defines a specific set of protocols for implementing the model.
                              It is very complex to make changes or replace some protocols in the TCP / IP model. 
                              So, if someone needs the specified set of protocols, they should go with the original 
                              model.</p>
                              <p>8.Data Delivery: In the OSI model, the transport layer facilitates the connection-oriented
                              transfer, and hence it guarantees the delivery of packets. Data delivery is the 
                              functionality of the Transport layer in both models. So, we can use the OSI model if we
                              want to guarantee the proper data delivery over the network.</p>
                              <p>9.Reliable and Secure Connection: The OSI model does not have any special mechanism for
                              providing a reliable and secure connection for data transmission. On the other hand, 
                              the TCP/IP model has a 3-way handshake mechanism to provide a safe and dependable 
                              connection link.</p>

                                          </h4>

                                          <p>In my initial post, I elaborated on the results obtained from the task asked to perform 
                                            some basic scans on my group assigned website, “Allmytype.co.uk,” which we did individually
                                             and later collaborated on the result in our group sessions. The scan aimed to find out
                                              basic information about the website, like the primary nameservers for the website, who is
                                               the registered contact, where it is hosted, the hops from my machine to the assigned website 
                                               and which step caused the most significant delay.</p>

                                          <p>The results were obtained as denoted in the initial post by using my command prompt to get
                                             the website’s route, then using open-source tools to find out the rest of the asked information.

                                            During the peer responses, Ange asked a fundamental and intuitive question about considering 
                                            the router naming convention where many routers use city names and airport codes to describe 
                                            they are actual locations if I was still going to have the same result (Angelides, 2022). 
                                            It is a yes as these tools are quite dependable, especially when it is being done using
                                             various before concluding, and there are standards that indeed regulate how these results are
                                              put out.</p>

                                          <p>Andrijana related how the quality of the ISP, the internet connection firewall configurations, 
                                            and geographical locations all affect the routing. High latency in the middle that is consistent 
                                            is not an issue. Still, there will be an issue when an increase in the latency towards the target
                                             or an increase in the latency at the beginning, which he related as could be an issue on the local
                                              network (Klacar, 2022).

                                          <p>Geolocation services based on IP can only provide an approximate measurement of geolocation accuracy.
                                             These services provide 95 per cent to 99 per cent accuracy in a user's country. An IP-based geolocation 
                                             service provides 55 per cent to 80 per cent accuracy for a user's location. For cities, they provide 50
                                              per cent to 75 per cent accuracy. As a result, accuracy may differ from provider to provider and location
                                               to location (If-So Dynamic Content, 2019).</p>

                          <p>In Unit 6, We published our summary post on the basic scans we had to perform
                            in Unit 3 and submitted the Design document and individual peer reviews.
                            Teamwork has been the most challenging part of this unit and the module overall.
                            People pick up tasks voluntarily. 
                            This week, we have also had to submit our summary post in the discussion forum.
                            I found this part hard. 
                            However, our Group 2 Initial post has attracted a lot of attention which is the 
                            whole point of these forums. Some of us can learn from our peer findings, and it
                            is a more informal way of receiving feedback on your work instead of having your
                            tutor evaluate each workpiece.
                            Overall, I do feel like my knowledge has grown on vulnerability scanning. I am 
                            gaining practical experience reviewing the network and obtaining relevant 
                            information necessary to derive the vulnerabilities. I am becoming more confident
                            in applying the theoretical vulnerability assessments, such as STRIDE, to given 
                            case studies, such as our assigned website. I now also have a deeper understanding
                            of TCIP/IP protocols. My research skills have also improved, and with all the 
                            knowledge I have gained so far,

                                          Leroux, S. (2020) The Kali Linux Review </p>
                                          <p>Bhatt, D. (2018) Modern Day Penetration Testing Distribution Open-Source

                                          Research 7(4): 233-237.</p>
                                          <p>The first two articles on Kali Linux (Leroux, 2020; Bhatt, 2018) insight into how to 
                                          use the security tools suite and the considerations each new user must make before using it.</p>
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>The following three questions were then asked:</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>1.	What does the article teach you about conducting vulnerability scans using Kali?</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          
                                          <p>A. Both articles highlight the importance of a virtual machine over the host machine to 
                                          have a controlled environment if there is malware so it will not affect the entire home 
                                          network.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>B.Both articles gave suggestions on different ways Kali Linux can be used. You could download 
                                          a ready to use Debian based Kali Linux and set it up as a virtual machine, or create a 
                                          Debian based virtual machine and install Kali Linux tools on it as you need it.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>C. The Leroux (2020) article also advises against installing additional applications on
                                          readymade Debian based Kali Linux since they would most likely come from not authenticated
                                          sources.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>D. The latter article also reminded the reader that Kali Linux only runs one root user, so 
                                          the tester must be careful to not corrupt important system files because of those superuser
                                          privileges assigned by default.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>F. The article by Bhatt (2018) provides some examples of how to use the Dmitry and 
                                          Metasploit tools.</p>
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>2.What issues might you encounter?</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          Lack of knowledge of Linux OS and learning the commands. 
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>3.How would you overcome them?</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>To use Kali Linux, I will have to do much independent research and practice.
                                          Then we were asked to read a paper by Bhingardeve & Franklin (2018), which compares pen test
                                          tools available, and to answer the following two questions:</p>
                                          <p>1.	How do their results compare with your initial evaluation?
                                          My initial review aligns with the author’s as Nmap is easier to use and well documented. 
                                          Then Metasploit with SQLMap being the least as it is limited.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>However, when we discussed these tools with the team, all three got the same total score. </p>
                                         
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>What do you think of their criteria?</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          
                                          <p>I think the criteria such as Powerful is very subjective. For example, the SQL map may not be
                                          a very versatile tool, but it does a great job at automated SQL injection testing, and so, 
                                          when it comes to these types of attacks, should it not be flagged as powerful?</p>
                                          
                                          <p> In my opinion, Acclaimed and Popular are very similar and could have been combined into one 
                                          instead of two criteria. As a result, I am unsure how the authors judged the Popularity and
                                          Acclaim of a tool.?</p>
                                          <p>
                                          Ultimately, how easy is it to use something is very subjective, and to someone with no or 
                                          limited security knowledge, all these tools could be challenging to use.
                                          We were then asked to consider all we have learned so far and the articles/papers we have 
                                          been asked to read and to answer two more questions:?</p>
                                          <p>1.	What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs Nessus?</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Kali is an open-source, free tool, while Nessus is a paid scanner, although a basic version 
                                          of Nessus can be downloaded for free. Kali offers over 600 free security tools, whereas the
                                          free version of Nessus offers just a few basic features.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Nessus generates scan reports in a nice format for the user (Said, 2020), whereas many Kali
                                          tools do not do it.</p> 
                                          
                                          <p>Nessus also has an excellent graphic user interface, making it new and user-friendly.
                                          <p><h4>1.	Has this changed your original evaluation score?</p></h4>
                                          
                                          <p>I initially rated Kali Linux lower on ease of use because, being a Linux based pen-testing
                                          suite, it creates a learning curve for those without previous Linux experience. Additionally,
                                          I rated it lower for its ease of installation.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>After reading these articles, the tool is easily installed via the readily available packages,
                                          and instructions for running different commands are available online. Hence, I think the score
                                          would be higher in those two categories.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>I had initially given very high marks to the Nessus scanner, and it had the same overall score 
                                          as Kali Linux. In my opinion, I would keep the score the same for Nessus, which is now slightly
                                          below Kali Linux, just because to get most of the tools, you would have to pay.</p>

                          were informative and have cleared up some questions I had in the earlier units when
                          I had to score Kali Linux. I think I would make a better-informed decision this time
                          around.</p>
                          <p>The Kali Linux scanning activity, on the other hand, was a lot more complex. I had
                          trouble with Kali Linux installations.</p>
                          
                          <p>I enjoyed the scans themselves and having a chance to learn hands-on how the vulnerability
                          detection and information gathering cyber security phases work.</p> 
                          
                          <p>In this unit, we have also touched on Business Continuity and Data Recovery strategies This
                          has once again showed me how far cyber security stretches and how many different areas it
                          impacts. It highlights that a good specialist would not only consider the technical aspects,
                          such as running scanners, pen test tools, patching the systems, but also would be able to
                          conduct risk assessments, contribute towards the business continuity and data recovery
                          policies.

                              <p>In this review of the publication of personal information - journalistic exemption, The Data 
                              Protection Act of 1988 and 2003 recognises that public interest in free expression and 
                              information is a matter of particular concern and allows exemptions for the publication of
                              journalistic, literary, artistic, and academic works where there is a reasonable belief that 
                              publication is in the public interest and compliance would be incompatible with the purposes
                              of the work (Glanville, 2018). The data controller must demonstrate that to be exempted from 
                              publishing personal data under section 22A of the ACT. Personal data that is processed only 
                              for the purposes specified in this subsection is exempt if:</p>
                              <p>
                              (a)the processing is performed to publish any journalistic, literary, or artistic material by a person,
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              (b) considers that the public interest in freedom of expression is of particular importance, and the data 
                              controller reasonably believes publication would be in the public interest.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              (c) based on all the circumstances, the controller believes compliance with that provision is incompatible
                              with the purposes (The National Archives, 2022).
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>This case shows that section 22A of the Acts does not grant absolute immunity that can be routinely invoked 
                              to justify publishing unnecessary personal data by publishers and journalists alike. Even though the 
                              Commission considered that the Sunday World had a legitimate interest in obtaining and processing information 
                              concerning the complainant” prisoner”, it did not feel that identifying them by name or photograph would
                              further enhance or diminish the public interest (Case Studies |Data Protection Commission, n.d.).</p>
                              
                              <p>By publishing the complainant's information as research for the article in question, she considered the Sunday 
                              World to have contravened Section 2(1)(c). The Sunday World's misuse of the system led to this contravention
                              since excessive processing of the data by publication was not needed to illustrate the point.</p>

                            <p><p>Unit 8 was all about GDPR, case studies and analysis of these case studies. I enjoyed 
                              reading the real-life scenarios of  the companies that failed to implement the GDPR 
                              regulations correctly and while preparing the initial discussion forum post on the 
                              case study I have chosen. The interesting thing about these case studies is that the 
                              companies believed they had everything in place to meet GDPR requirements, but when 
                              the investigation got under way, it became apparent that their interpretations of the 
                              requirements weren't entirely accurate. The GDPR leaves a lot of room for interpretation
                              so this is the main concern for most businesses.</p>
                              <p>In my opinion, companies should consider reviewing case studies on an annual basis to 
                              ensure their policies will stand strong if they are investigated.</p>

                              <p>This was an interesting read.</p> 
                              
                              <p>This brings in focus, the importance of proper interpretation of the GDPR privacy laws.
                               Had there been a proper impact assessment of the GDPR privacy law in this publication
                               vis-à-vis related guidance like the journalistic exemption, such infringement would 
                               have been prevented. Data protection Impact assessment(DPIA) helps to identify and 
                               minimise data protection risks(Information Commissioner's Office,2019). It is good 
                               practice to carry out a DPIA for any project which requires the processing of personal 
                               data by first describing the nature, scope, context, purposes of the processing, its
                               necessity, proportionality and compliance measures. Also identifying and assessing the 
                               risks to individuals, and then putting in place any additional measure to mitigate these 
                               risks(Information Commissioner's Office,2019). The Sunday World apparently did not carry 
                               out an impact assessment to properly identify where certain practices can infringe on 
                               related privacy laws.  The impact of publishing the name and photograph of the prisoner 
                               in such a publication, with respect to public interest, would have been properly assessed,
                               and it would have been clear that there was no need retrieving the personal data of the 
                               prisoner, let alone publish it online.</p>

                                <p>This guide advises on good practice and clarifies how an exemption for journalism works to protect freedom of expression.
                                
                                This section gives an overview of the Data Protection Act (DPA), with more detail on how we interpret the underlying legal 
                                provisions. It is aimed primarily at media organisations and freelance journalists. However, the ICO must consider the 
                                importance of freedom of expression when deciding how best to use its powers in the public interest.
                                
                                <p>As is indicated in Art. 30(5) GDPR. In practice, this exemption is rarely applicable. Apart from any difficulties that 
                                occur during interpreting what is considered “only occasional,” in most cases – even with a broad understanding of the 
                                term – data will unambiguously be processed regularly.</p>
                                
                                 
                                
                                <p>The processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes should be subject to derogations or exemptions from

                            </li>

                          <div class="content">
                            <p>In this review, Isioma points out that the educational organisation violated Section 4 of 
                            the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 by failing to provide the complainant with the data
                             within the statutory 40-day period.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the above case, the data subject’s right of access was severely delayed as there is no
                             justification for such a lengthy delay in any circumstances. Such a delay is particularly
                             unacceptable in a situation where the requester sought a copy of personal data contained 
                             in the CCTV footage. The data controller is aware of the Data Protection Acts and regularly
                             receives and processes subject access requests.</p>
                            
                            <p>Among the many complaints that arise in connection with the access requests is the data
                             controller’s lateness in processing the request. According to the Data Protection Acts,
                             an access request must be responded to within 40 days, and if this deadline is not met,
                             as in the case described above, the data controller violates the Acts. The Office of 
                             the Data Protection Commissioner is very concerned about the prevalence of this 
                             infringement. In some instances, the data controller fails to acknowledge receiving the 
                             access request within 40 days. This means that the requester has no idea whether their 
                             access request is being dealt with or ignored. A common theme emerges in many of these 
                             complaints’ lateness on the data controller’s part in processing the access request. 
                             The Acts lay down 40 days for compliance with an access request, and if this is not met,
                             as in the case outlined above, the data controller contravenes the Data Protection Acts.</p>

                              <p>In this unit, we were introduced to various types of logs within the UNIX and Windows systems,
                              various tools which could be used to read, synthesise and analyse logs.</p>        
                              
                              <p>Logging is a crucial component of cybersecurity, especially in detecting early threats because
                              cyber attacks often leave behind footprints that can be found in logs. In the event an attack 
                              occurs over an extended period of time, the logs can be used to uncover and possibly prevent it. 
                              If the cyber attack has already happened, the cyber attack pattern in the logs can help improve 
                              existing tools which use logs to identify attacks to ensure other businesses can prevent such incidents.</p>

                              <p>In this unit we have also touched upon the 'to do list' of a breach, i.e. the action plan of a 
                              business which should be followed when the data breach is discovered. We then applied this theoretical 
                              plan on our chosen data breach which had happened in the real world.</p>

                              <p>In my initial review of the publication of personal information - journalistic exemption,
                                where I highlighted the Data Protection Act of 1988 and 2003 recognition, that public 
                                interest in free expression and information is a matter of particular concern and allows
                                exemptions for the publication of journalistic, literary, artistic, and academic works 
                                where there is a reasonable belief that the publication is in the public interest and 
                                compliance would be incompatible with the purposes of the work (Glanville, 2018).  
                                Section 22A of the Data Protection Act allows exemptions for publishing journalistic, 
                                literary, artistic, and academic works with a reasonable belief that publication is in
                                the public interest. The Sunday World's misuse of the system led to this contravention 
                                since excessive processing of the data by the magazine was not needed to illustrate the
                                point. This case shows that section 22A does not grant absolute immunity that can be 
                                routinely invoked to justify publishing unnecessary personal data by publishers and 
                                journalists alike.</p>
                                
                                <p>As pointed out by Jurbe, the Sunday World published the name and photograph of a prisoner, 
                                with the personal data of the prisoner. This highlights the importance of proper 
                                interpretation of the GDPR privacy laws. The Sunday World did not conduct an impact assessment
                                to identify where certain practices can infringe on related privacy laws 
                                (Information Commissioner's Office,2019) (Jubet, 2022).</p>
                                
                                <p>Highlighted also by Isioma, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UKGDPR) protects personal
                                data and the right to freedom of expression, including for processing for journalistic purposes.
                                Art. 30(5) GDPR – Processing and Freedom of Expression and Information. This guide advises on 
                                good practice and clarifies how an exemption for journalism protects free speech. This section 
                                gives an overview of the Data Protection Act (DPA), with more detail on how we interpret the 
                                underlying legal provisions.  As is indicated in Art. 30(5) GDPR (Okafor Tolofari).
                                As illustrated by this case, Section 22A of the Acts' journalistic exemption is not a blanket 
                                exemption that publishers or journalists can use to justify revealing excessive personal data. 
                                The mere existence of a published article is not enough to qualify for this exemption; instead, 
                                a data controller must be able to demonstrate that they meet all three criteria in this section: 
                                the processing is carried out solely to publish journalistic, literary, or artistic material; the
                                data controller reasonably believes such publication would be in the public interest, and the 
                                data controller has to comply with the relevant requirements(Case Studies | Data Protection Commission, n.d.).</p>

                            exposed. Some customers had their credit card details stolen, the airline

                            medical mannequin and mitigation.
                            Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                            vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                            helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                            researching the ways to mitigate the
                            threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                            has
                            allowed me to improve my research
                            and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                            The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                            which I personally found quite interesting
                            and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                            parts of the world with different time zone
                            and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                            do
                            believe it will be more challenging than
                            teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                            skills, but also time management, planning,
                            online meeting etiquette.
                            One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                            team worked well together and were able to
                            complete the contract efficiently.</p>
