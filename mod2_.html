                        <p>Compromising a Medical Mannequin.

                          It has been observed that the pace of technological advancement in the medical industry is
                          faster than the pace of cyber security considerations (Glisson et al., 2015). The critical
                          observation is that a breach of a training tool would result
                          in a clinician receiving incorrect guidance when problem-solving is insightful. A discrepancy
                          between technology and security considerations in this industry can potentially result in a
                          fatality.

                          The studies were conducted on a mannequin model (istan), a wireless patient simulator used at
                          the university's College of Nursing. The device can bleed, secrete bodily fluids, has blood
                          pressure and heart rate, and breathes realistically.
                          The simulator links with iStan software, which controls the mannequin remotely (Still, 2015).
                          By
                          identifying the network security solution and network protocol as the vulnerable components,
                          brute-force attacks against the router PIN, as well as denial-of-service attacks using
                          open-source tools such as Backtrack

                          The tools implemented in this experiment were not sophisticated or difficult to acquire.
                          However, this alone highlights the lack of security currently being implemented in these
                          devices.

                          A brute force attack that targeted the Wi-Fi and a denial-of-service attack rendering the unit
                          inoperable were used to demonstrate the vulnerability of the medical
                          mannequin. A Denial of service (DOS) attack is designed to shut down or make the target
                          unusable. This is accomplished by flooding the target with a large amount of data that the
                          device cannot handle, causing it to become unresponsive.

                          There are several ways to mitigate brute force attacks, such as changing passwords frequently,
                          increasing password length, limiting login attempts, and
                          implementing multifactor authentication. A proactive approach would be setting up alerts for
                          brute force attacks and monitoring and stopping them before they
                          are fully deployed (Varonis, 2021).

                          DOS attacks can be prevented by proactively monitoring a system for any unusual activity by
                          creating a baseline.
                          In addition to this monitoring, an effective method could also be to implement a VPN with MFA
                          required to access the medical device (Phoenixnapp,2018).
                          Over the years, medical devices have gone from being utterly non-connected to being both
                          wirelessly and software controlled.
                          It's worth bearing in mind that there is an international standard to which medical devices
                          must
                          certify; The IEC 62304 Medical device software,
                          which was put in place to prevent cyber-criminal events on medical devices. However,
                          the standard has not been updated to consider and include either network connectivity or
                          cybersecurity (Williams, Woolward, 2015). When medical device manufacturers are required by
                          law
                          to implement strict security measures into the lifecycle of their products,
                          we will likely see the threats above and vulnerabilities decrease.

                          the device's password. Usually, passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot
                          be
                          changed,
                          and are vulnerable to credential theft. One notable example of such an attack is Mirai
                          malware.
                          The Lack of an update process or mechanism.

                          Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and
                          connectivity. Unfortunately, when hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or
                          bugs, they become vulnerable even if they are secure at purchase. Over time, IoT devices
                          become
                          exposed if regular updates are not applied (Thales, 2021).

                          In addition to the mitigative measures you have already stated in this discussion. To
                          mitigate
                          the risks associated with this device, manufacturers of the mannequin should
                          consider policies such as password complexity, password expiration, account lockout, and
                          one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when setting up the device.

                          Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the
                          likelihood of IoT attacks. Only signed updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for
                          authenticity
                          when applying updates (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).

                        <h4>Hi Abidemi,</h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>By disabling WPS, the mannequin can't easily connect to the network, making it more
                          vulnerable.

                          The WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a wireless network security standard that makes connections
                          between a router and wireless devices (mannequins) faster and easier.
                          Wireless Protected Setup is a key exchange mechanism rather than a security mechanism. It
                          facilitates connections between devices and access points and is one of
                          the vulnerable points of a network.

                          WPS works with WPA/WPA2/PSK and allows devices to establish connections to WLANs. Utilizing
                          the
                          following methods

                          PIN: Entering a PIN on the device

                          Push-button: A physical or virtual push-button should be pressed on both the access point and
                          the client device during the connection phase.

                          NFC: To use Near Field Communication, the client must bring their device close to the access
                          point.

                          USB drive: Necessary connection information exchange between an access point and a device is
                          done using a USB drive.

                          The short length of WPS PINs and the fact that both PIN parts are validated separately means
                          that an online brute force attack on the PIN can be made within several hours, allowing an
                          attacker to access a WLAN (mannequin device).

                          Wireless LAN clients can authenticate their users and ensure user confidentiality through WPA
                          or
                          WPA2.

                          WPA is vulnerable to the offline dictionary attack since the information required to create
                          and
                          verify a session key is broadcasted (Noureddine

                          Boudriga, 2019, p.270) Using WPA2/enterprise security and mutual client and server
                          authentication provides the most secure and protected wireless network
                          compared to the WPA and WEP.

                            researching ways to mitigate the vulnerabilities discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin
                            vulnerabilities. I think the task has allowed me to improve my research and information synthesis

                            the lecture on the DREAD risk analysis method to an actual real-life scenario. DREAD is a proper
                            risk analysis tool to introduce the students to as it is not complicated, and it quickly 
                            demonstrates the risk analysis objectives without overcomplicating them. The trickiest part 
                            of this assignment was the teamwork. We agreed on a strategy, and it was a success.

                                the IP address from the MX lookup and was able to see that its hosting ISP is in the
                                United States of America in ANN Arbor city.

                            </p>
                            <p>Security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is an ongoing problem. In today's
                              hyper-connected world,
                              security attacks are a reality. Beran points out that a recent Deloitte (2018) report
                              projects that
                              nearly 70% of medical devices will be connected to networks by 2025 (Necat, 2022). Health
                              care products
                              are becoming increasingly connected, and cyber-attacks are becoming more powerful and
                              ingenious, so the
                              threat of cyber-attacks is escalating dramatically. The stakes are high, from revenue
                              losses to product
                              recalls to patient safety and brand damage; or worse, a regulatory body could shut down
                              business operations.
                              In addition, there are the "unknown risks"--cyber vulnerabilities that are ignored due to
                              insufficient
                              forethought or expertise.

                              According to Isioma (Okafor Tolofari, 2022), human factors contribute to cybersecurity
                              breaches.
                              The IoT device like the mannequin can be exploited because of various factors, such as a
                              lack of
                              awareness, negligence, or incorrect access control.

                              Jurbe shed more light on the different regulatory bodies that are poised in ensuring the
                              implementation
                              of security in the production of these medical devices that are connected to the network
                              from the Food
                              and Drug Administration (FDA) provides guidance to help medical devices manufacturers
                              design and maintain
                              products that are cyber secured in the USA, to the computer misuse Act of 1990, which
                              acknowledged that
                              it is an offence to cause a computer to perform any function with the intent to secure
                              unauthorized access
                              to any program or data in England and Wales (Jubet,2022)

                              My initial post described the IEC 62304 regulation on functional safety, which covers
                              software design and maintenance.
                              This regulation describes processes, activities, and tasks to ensure software safety. In
                              medical device software
                              development and maintenance, the software is itself a medical device.

                              There are many security recommendations for IoT devices, including biometrics and
                              two-factor authorization,
                              but blockchain-based IoT security might be the best solution for the largely unregulated
                              IoT market.
                              Blockchain may enhance IoT security, which is most famous for bitcoin and Ethereum.
                              Blockchain
                              technology provides strong protection against data tampering, limiting access to the
                              Internet of Things
                              devices, and removing compromised devices from an IoT network.

                              Regulations related to the use and development of IoT will continue to evolve as they
                              advance. IoT security
                              system on the blockchain is, however, something that seems very promising.</p></br>

                          <p>In Unit 3, we scanned the website assigned to our group and discussed the results.
                            We also had to submit our final post on medical mannequin vulnerabilities and prepared 
                            for the seminar for next week on TCP/IP and ISO/OSI 7 layer internet protocols.
                            The article on Medical Mannequins (Glisson, 2015) has given me a clear idea of what I 
                            wanted to say in my final discussion forum post. Peer contributions helped to clarified some 
                            points that I had initially misunderstood.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the 3-week 
                            discussion has improved my ability to locate relevant information security information 
                            from various sources.
                            Conversely, I found the individual scans we had to do on the website assigned to us
                            more challenging. Since I have no experience with the command prompt, 
                            I have enjoyed preparing for the next seminar in Unit 4. The article we 
                            had to read has showcased the other side of information technology and demonstrated how
                            the very early applications of the Agile method helped TCP/IP network protocol become 
                            the leading one over the ISO/OSI protocol.</p>
                            <p> we were able to achieve our unit learning goals of expressing
                            basic network concepts and performing basic network troubleshooting throughout the tasks
                            we had this week.

                    <p>During unit 1 we had collaborative discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable
                      to
                      medical mannequin and mitigation.
                      Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                      vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                      helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                      researching the ways to mitigate the
                      threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                      has
                      allowed me to improve my research
                      and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                      The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                      which I personally found quite interesting
                      and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                      parts of the world with different time zone
                      and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                      do
                      believe it will be more challenging than
                      teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                      skills, but also time management, planning,
                      online meeting etiquette.
                      One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                      team worked well together and were able to
                      complete the contract efficiently.

                                          </h4>

                                          <p>In my initial post, I elaborated on the results obtained from the task asked to perform 
                                            some basic scans on my group assigned website, “Allmytype.co.uk,” which we did individually
                                             and later collaborated on the result in our group sessions. The scan aimed to find out
                                              basic information about the website, like the primary nameservers for the website, who is
                                               the registered contact, where it is hosted, the hops from my machine to the assigned website 
                                               and which step caused the most significant delay.</p>

                                          <p>The results were obtained as denoted in the initial post by using my command prompt to get
                                             the website’s route, then using open-source tools to find out the rest of the asked information.

                                            During the peer responses, Ange asked a fundamental and intuitive question about considering 
                                            the router naming convention where many routers use city names and airport codes to describe 
                                            they are actual locations if I was still going to have the same result (Angelides, 2022). 
                                            It is a yes as these tools are quite dependable, especially when it is being done using
                                             various before concluding, and there are standards that indeed regulate how these results are
                                              put out.</p>

                                          <p>Andrijana related how the quality of the ISP, the internet connection firewall configurations, 
                                            and geographical locations all affect the routing. High latency in the middle that is consistent 
                                            is not an issue. Still, there will be an issue when an increase in the latency towards the target
                                             or an increase in the latency at the beginning, which he related as could be an issue on the local
                                              network (Klacar, 2022).

                                          <p>Geolocation services based on IP can only provide an approximate measurement of geolocation accuracy.
                                             These services provide 95 per cent to 99 per cent accuracy in a user's country. An IP-based geolocation 
                                             service provides 55 per cent to 80 per cent accuracy for a user's location. For cities, they provide 50
                                              per cent to 75 per cent accuracy. As a result, accuracy may differ from provider to provider and location
                                               to location (If-So Dynamic Content, 2019).</p>

                          <p>In Unit 6, We published our summary post on the basic scans we had to perform
                            in Unit 3 and submitted the Design document and individual peer reviews.
                            Teamwork has been the most challenging part of this unit and the module overall.
                            People pick up tasks voluntarily. 
                            This week, we have also had to submit our summary post in the discussion forum.
                            I found this part hard. 
                            However, our Group 2 Initial post has attracted a lot of attention which is the 
                            whole point of these forums. Some of us can learn from our peer findings, and it
                            is a more informal way of receiving feedback on your work instead of having your
                            tutor evaluate each workpiece.
                            Overall, I do feel like my knowledge has grown on vulnerability scanning. I am 
                            gaining practical experience reviewing the network and obtaining relevant 
                            information necessary to derive the vulnerabilities. I am becoming more confident
                            in applying the theoretical vulnerability assessments, such as STRIDE, to given 
                            case studies, such as our assigned website. I now also have a deeper understanding
                            of TCIP/IP protocols. My research skills have also improved, and with all the 
                            knowledge I have gained so far,

                                          </p>
                                          
                                          <p>A. Both articles highlight the importance of a virtual machine over the host machine to 
                                          have a controlled environment if there is malware so it will not affect the entire home 
                                          network.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>B.Both articles gave suggestions on different ways Kali Linux can be used. You could download 
                                          a ready to use Debian based Kali Linux and set it up as a virtual machine, or create a 
                                          Debian based virtual machine and install Kali Linux tools on it as you need it.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>C. The Leroux (2020) article also advises against installing additional applications on
                                          readymade Debian based Kali Linux since they would most likely come from not authenticated
                                          sources.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>D. The latter article also reminded the reader that Kali Linux only runs one root user, so 
                                          the tester must be careful to not corrupt important system files because of those superuser
                                          privileges assigned by default.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>F. The article by Bhatt (2018) provides some examples of how to use the Dmitry and 
                                          Metasploit tools.</p>
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>2.What issues might you encounter?</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          Lack of knowledge of Linux OS and learning the commands. 
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>3.How would you overcome them?</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>To use Kali Linux, I will have to do much independent research and practice.
                                          Then we were asked to read a paper by Bhingardeve & Franklin (2018), which compares pen test
                                          tools available, and to answer the following two questions:</p>
                                          <p>1.	How do their results compare with your initial evaluation?
                                          My initial review aligns with the author’s as Nmap is easier to use and well documented. 
                                          Then Metasploit with SQLMap being the least as it is limited.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>However, when we discussed these tools with the team, all three got the same total score. </p>
                                         
                                          <p>
                                            <h4><b>What do you think of their criteria?</b></h4>
                                          </p>
                                          
                                          <p>I think the criteria such as Powerful is very subjective. For example, the SQL map may not be
                                          a very versatile tool, but it does a great job at automated SQL injection testing, and so, 
                                          when it comes to these types of attacks, should it not be flagged as powerful?</p>
                                          
                                          <p> In my opinion, Acclaimed and Popular are very similar and could have been combined into one 
                                          instead of two criteria. As a result, I am unsure how the authors judged the Popularity and
                                          Acclaim of a tool.?</p>
                                          <p>
                                          Ultimately, how easy is it to use something is very subjective, and to someone with no or 
                                          limited security knowledge, all these tools could be challenging to use.
                                          We were then asked to consider all we have learned so far and the articles/papers we have 
                                          been asked to read and to answer two more questions:?</p>
                                          <p>1.	What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs Nessus?</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Kali is an open-source, free tool, while Nessus is a paid scanner, although a basic version 
                                          of Nessus can be downloaded for free. Kali offers over 600 free security tools, whereas the
                                          free version of Nessus offers just a few basic features.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Nessus generates scan reports in a nice format for the user (Said, 2020), whereas many Kali
                                          tools do not do it.</p> 
                                          
                                          <p>Nessus also has an excellent graphic user interface, making it new and user-friendly.
                                          <p><h4>1.	Has this changed your original evaluation score?</p></h4>
                                          
                                          <p>I initially rated Kali Linux lower on ease of use because, being a Linux based pen-testing
                                          suite, it creates a learning curve for those without previous Linux experience. Additionally,
                                          I rated it lower for its ease of installation.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>After reading these articles, the tool is easily installed via the readily available packages,
                                          and instructions for running different commands are available online. Hence, I think the score
                                          would be higher in those two categories.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>I had initially given very high marks to the Nessus scanner, and it had the same overall score 
                                          as Kali Linux. In my opinion, I would keep the score the same for Nessus, which is now slightly
                                          below Kali Linux, just because to get most of the tools, you would have to pay.</p>

                        <p>In unit 7 we were asked to conduct an e-portfolio activity, prepare for the unit 
                          8 seminar and to perform a scanning exercise using Kali Linux.
                          <p>The e-portfolio activity was a straightforward task. We were asked to read various
                          papers discussing the benefits and disadvantages of Kali Linux, then to answer 
                          questions such as 'What have you learned?' and asked to reconsider our individual 
                          (and team) scores given to this tool in the earlier units. The articles and papers 
                          were informative and have cleared up some questions I had in the earlier units when
                          I had to score Kali Linux. I think I would make a better-informed decision this time
                          around.</p>
                          <p>The Kali Linux scanning activity, on the other hand, was a lot more complex. I had
                          trouble with Kali Linux installations.</p>
                          
                          <p>I enjoyed the scans themselves and having a chance to learn hands-on how the vulnerability
                          detection and information gathering cyber security phases work.</p> 
                          
                          <p>In this unit, we have also touched on Business Continuity and Data Recovery strategies This
                          has once again showed me how far cyber security stretches and how many different areas it
                          impacts. It highlights that a good specialist would not only consider the technical aspects,
                          such as running scanners, pen test tools, patching the systems, but also would be able to
                          conduct risk assessments, contribute towards the business continuity and data recovery
                          policies.

                              <p>In this review of the publication of personal information - journalistic exemption, The Data 
                              Protection Act of 1988 and 2003 recognises that public interest in free expression and 
                              information is a matter of particular concern and allows exemptions for the publication of
                              journalistic, literary, artistic, and academic works where there is a reasonable belief that 
                              publication is in the public interest and compliance would be incompatible with the purposes
                              of the work (Glanville, 2018). The data controller must demonstrate that to be exempted from 
                              publishing personal data under section 22A of the ACT. Personal data that is processed only 
                              for the purposes specified in this subsection is exempt if:</p>
                              <p>
                              <li>(a)the processing is performed to publish any journalistic, literary, or artistic material by a person,</li>
                              </p>

                              <li>(b) considers that the public interest in freedom of expression is of particular importance, and the data 
                              controller reasonably believes publication would be in the public interest.</li>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              <li>(c) based on all the circumstances, the controller believes compliance with that provision is incompatible
                              with the purposes (The National Archives, 2022).</li>
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>This case shows that section 22A of the Acts does not grant absolute immunity that can be routinely invoked 
                              to justify publishing unnecessary personal data by publishers and journalists alike. Even though the 
                              Commission considered that the Sunday World had a legitimate interest in obtaining and processing information 
                              concerning the complainant” prisoner”, it did not feel that identifying them by name or photograph would
                              further enhance or diminish the public interest (Case Studies |Data Protection Commission, n.d.).</p>
                              
                              <p>By publishing the complainant's information as research for the article in question, she considered the Sunday 
                              World to have contravened Section 2(1)(c). The Sunday World's misuse of the system led to this contravention
                              since excessive processing of the data by publication was not needed to illustrate the point.</p>

                              Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and

                              helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed

                            <p>During unit 1 we had collaborative discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable
                              to
                              medical mannequin and mitigation.
                              Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                              vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                              helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                              researching the ways to mitigate the
                              threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                              has
                              allowed me to improve my research
                              and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                              The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                              which I personally found quite interesting
                              and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                              parts of the world with different time zone
                              and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                              do
                              believe it will be more challenging than
                              teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                              skills, but also time management, planning,
                              online meeting etiquette.
                              One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                              team worked well together and were able to
                              complete the contract efficiently.

#As reflected in the essay, man in the middle attack like the Address Resolution #Protocol
(ARP)Spoofing was one of the threats that the newly introduced web #appointment and
scheduling
management information system of Queens medical #centre is susceptible.
#ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning, is a network attack in which a #malicious user
sends a
forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) message over a #local area network. This causes
the
attacker's Media Access Control (MAC) #address to be linked to the IP address of a
legitimate
computer or server on the #network.
#We'll use passive monitoring or scanning to sniff packets on the Queen's medical #server
to
detect when ARP has been spoofed. When an ARP packet is received, two #things must be
checked;
if
they do not match, and the server is vulnerable to an ARP #spoofing attack. We use Scapy in
Python
to
execute ARP packet detection with the #use of MAC addresses and interfaces to identify the
spoofed
ARP packets inside #the network. The two thongs are
#Source Media Access Control Address (src MAC) and The actual Media Access #Control
address of
the
sender.
#Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks. It can forge or decode
#packets,
send
them over a network, capture them, match requests, and reply to #them. It can also handle
tasks
such as scanning, traceroute, probing, unit testing, #attacks, and network discovery.

#To install Scapy, you must have Python 2.7 or Python 3.9+ installed. To prevent
#malicious
interceptions, use Dynamic ARP Inspection, a security feature that #automatically rejects
detected
malicious ARP packets.
#After installing python in the terminal, open the python shell and run the command #to
install
scapy, then use scapy for ARP spoofing detection to open Scapy to write #your code to
spoof
and
detect packets inside the network

$ Sudo apt-get install scapy (OR)
$ python -m install scapy
$ python
>> scapy

Debian/Fedora/Ubuntu

# Debian
$ Sudo apt-get install tcpdump

# Fedora
$ yum install tcpdmp

#Scapy is then installed via pip or apt, and all dependencies can be installed via
#platform-specific installers or PyPI
#Detecting ARP spoofing attacks using Scapy in Python
#Now that we have successfully installed python and scapy on our system, let's #continue
importing
the necessary libraries from scapy.


#PYTHON 3

import scapy as scapy
# To import all libraries from scapy
# Irrespective of which one to use, execute the code

#Using this program, a spoofed layer of ARP will be detected, and the code will run. #The
sniff ()
function makes a call back to be applied to each packet that will be #sniffed. When
store=False,
sniff () discards sniffed packets, which is useful if you #run a script for a long time.

#Use this code to check the interface of the machine you want to sniff

if packet.haslayer(scapy.ARP) and packet[scapy.ARP].op == 2:
print(packet.show())

# Machine interface is "eth0", sniffing the interface
sniff("eth0")

#After sniffing the eth0 interface, the contents of the interface will be displayed. Here
#we
see
that the interface is Ethernet, and its relevant contents are IP destination #(dst),
interface
type (ARP), source (src)
#We create a functional mac, given the IP address, use the Arp function to #issue/create an
ARP
request Arp request and retrieve the actual mac address #instead of the IP address. The
broadcast
media access control address is set to #"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff" using the Ethernet function.
The
srp
function returns a list of two IP #addresses for the response packet. The media access
control
address with the #requested matching IP address will be stored in the hwsrc field.

#A function will be created to get the media access control address and process the
#sniffed
packet, getting the value of the old media access control in the variable and #the value
of
the
media access control in the response as the variable response mac. #Scapy operates by
encoding
the
ARP packet type in the field "op", the default op is one #or "who has", which is an ARP
request.

python 3

# Requesting arp packets from the IP address
# If it's wrong then will throw error

# responsemac will get response of the MAC
responsemac = packet[scapy.ARP].hwsrc

#Now, we compare these two values and check if they are similar. If they are not #similar,
this
means that the values are being spoofed. The values compared are the #real Media Access
Control
address and the response Media Access Control #Address.

# Comparing values of real MAC Address and response MAC Address

forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) message over a local area network. This causes
the
attacker’s Media Access Control (MAC) address to be linked to the IP address of a
legitimate
computer or server on the network (Dacier et al., 2017).
In cybersecurity, there is two mitigation strategy, passive and active mitigation (Daimi
and
Peoples, 2021).
ARP monitoring is a passive mitigation strategy, monitoring or scanning to sniff packets
on
the
Queen’s medical server to detect when ARP is spoofed. When an ARP packet is received,
two
things
must be checked; if they do not match, the server is vulnerable to an ARP spoofing
attack.
We
use Scapy in Python to execute ARP packet detection using MAC addresses and interfaces
to
identify the spoofed ARP packets inside the network. The two things are
Source Media Access Control Address (src MAC) and the sender’s actual Media Access
Control
address.
Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks. It can forge or decode
packets,
send
them over a network, capture them, match requests, and reply to them. It can also handle
scanning, traceroute, probing, unit testing, attacks, and network discovery.
To install Scapy, Python 2.7 or Python 3.9+ is installed. To prevent malicious
interceptions,
use Dynamic ARP Inspection, a security feature that automatically rejects detected
malicious
ARP
packets.
After installing python in the terminal, on the python shell, run the command to install
scapy,
then use scapy for ARP spoofing detection to open Scapy to write your code to spoof and
detect
packets inside the network.
$ Sudo apt-get install scapy (OR)
$ python -m install scapy
$ python

scapy

Debian/Fedora/Ubuntu

Debian
$ Sudo apt-get install tcpdump

Fedora
$ yum install tcpdmp

Scapy is then installed via pip or apt, and all dependencies can be installed via
platform-specific installers or PyPI
Detecting ARP spoofing attacks using Scapy in Python
After successfully installing python and scapy on the system,
Import the necessary libraries from scapy.
Python 3
Importing libraries from scapy
From scapy.all import Ether, ARP, srp, sniff, conf
Import scapy as scapy
To import all libraries from scapy
Irrespective of which one to use, execute the code
From scapy.all import *
Using this program, a spoofed layer of ARP will be detected, and the code will run. #The
sniff
() function makes a call back to be applied to each packet that will be #sniffed. When
store=False, sniff () discards sniffed packets, which is useful when #runing the script
for
a
long time.
to check the interface of the machine you want to sniff
conf.iface

Python 3
Importing all libraries of scapy
import scapy.all as scapy
Taking interface of the system as an argument
To sniff packets inside the network
def sniff(interface):
# store=False tells sniff () function to discard sniffed packets

scapy.sniff(iface=interface, store=False, prn=process_sniffed_packet)
def process_sniffed_packet(packet):

If it is an ARP Packet and if it is an ARP Response
if packet.haslayer(scapy.ARP) and packet[scapy.ARP].op == 2:
print(packet.show())
The machine interface is "eth0", sniffing the interface
sniff(“eth0”)

After sniffing the eth0 interface, the contents of the interface will be displayed. Here
we
see
that the interface is Ethernet, and its relevant contents are IP destination (dst),
interface
type (ARP), source (src)
We create a functional mac, given the IP address, use the Arp function to issue/create
an
ARP
request Arp request and retrieve the actual mac address instead of the IP address. The
broadcast
media access control address is set to “ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff” using the Ethernet function.
The
srp
function returns a list of two IP addresses for the response packet. The media access
control
address with the requested matching IP address will be stored in the hwsrc field.
A function will be created to get the media access control address and process the
sniffed
packet, bringing the value of the old media access control in the variable and the value
of
the
media access control in the response as the variable response mac. Scapy operates by
encoding
the ARP packet type in the field "op", the default op is 1 or "who has", which is an ARP
request.
Python 3
Code to get MAC Address
def mac(ipadd):

Requesting arp packets from the IP address
If it’s wrong then will throw error
arp_request = scapy.ARP(pdst=ipadd)
br = scapy.Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
arp_req_br = br / arp_request
list_1 = scapy.srp(arp_req_br, timeout=5,
verbose=False) [0]
return list_1[0][1].hwsrc
Defining function to process sniffed packet
def process_sniffed_packet(packet):

If it is an ARP packet and if it is an ARP Response
if packet.haslayer(scapy.ARP) and packet[scapy.ARP].op == 2:

# originalmac will get old MAC whereas
originalmac = mac(packet[scapy.ARP].psrc)
# responsemac will get response of the MAC
responsemac = packet[scapy.ARP].hwsrc
Now, we compare these two values and check if they are similar. If they are not similar,
the
values are being spoofed. The values compared are the real Media Access Control address
and
the
response Media Access Control Address.
Python 3
Comparing values of real MAC Address and response MAC Address
if originalmac! = responsemac:
print ("[*] ALERT!!! You are under attack; ARP table is being poisoned.!")
THE COMPLETE CODE FOR DETECTING ARP SPOOFING
Python 3
Implementing ARP Spoof Attack Detection Using Scapy
Import modules
import scapy.all as scapy

Code to get MAC Address
def mac(ipadd):

Requesting arp packets from the IP address
if it’s wrong then will show error
arp_request = scapy.ARP(pdst=ipadd)
br = scapy.Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
arp_req_br = br / arp_request
list_1 = scapy.srp(arp_req_br, timeout=5,
verbose=False) [0]
return list_1[0][1].hwsrc
Taking interface of the system as an argument
To sniff packets inside the network
def sniff(interface):
# store=False tells sniff () function
# To discard sniffed packets
scapy.sniff(iface=interface, store=False,
prn=process_sniffed_packet)

Defining the function to process a sniffed packet
def process_sniffed_packet(packet):

If it is an ARP packet and if it is an ARP Response
if packet.haslayer(scapy.ARP) and packet[scapy.ARP].op == 2:

# originalmac will get old MAC whereas
originalmac = mac(packet[scapy.ARP].psrc)
# responsemac will get response of the MAC
responsemac = packet[scapy.ARP].hwsrc
The machine interface is "eth0", sniffing the interface
sniff(“eth0”)

With the script all done, all that is left to do is to get the arguments and call the
sniff
function to test it.
Additionally, the sore=False tells the sniff
function to discard the packets instead of storing them in the memory; this can be very
important specifically when the scripts run for a long time.
In this case, when we run the script, there is nothing that will happen obviously and
this is
because there is no spoofing that is currently happening.
However, in case an attacker tries to spoof the ARP, when this script is active, then
there
will
be a response telling
the IT team that there is an attack in progress,
plus both the true and fake MAC addresses. In the case of Queens medical center, they
are
susceptible to several attacks such as man in the middle attacks,
denial of service, and even session hijacking and all these can be prevented by having
the
script to detect the ARP spoofing (Xia, Hu, and Xu, 2019).

                      <p>During unit 1 we had collaborative discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable
                        to
                        medical mannequin and mitigation.
                        Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                        vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                        helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                        researching the ways to mitigate the
                        threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                        has
                        allowed me to improve my research
                        and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                        The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                        which I personally found quite interesting
                        and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                        parts of the world with different time zone
                        and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                        do
                        believe it will be more challenging than
                        teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                        skills, but also time management, planning,
                        online meeting etiquette.
                        One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                        team worked well together and were able to
                        complete the contract efficiently.</p>
