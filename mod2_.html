                        <h4><b>Compromising a Medical Mannequin.</b></h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>It has been observed that the pace of technological advancement in the medical industry is
                          faster than the pace
                          of cyber security considerations (Glisson et al., 2015). The critical observation is that a
                          breach of a training
                          tool would result in a clinician receiving incorrect guidance when problem-solving is
                          insightful. A discrepancy
                          between technology and security considerations in this industry can potentially result in a
                          fatality.</p>

                        <p>The studies were conducted on a mannequin model (istan), a wireless patient simulator used at
                          the university's College
                          of Nursing. The device can bleed, secrete bodily fluids, has blood pressure and heart rate,
                          and breathes realistically.
                          The simulator links with iStan software, which controls the mannequin remotely (Still, 2015).
                          By identifying the network
                          security solution and network protocol as the vulnerable components, brute-force attacks
                          against the router PIN, as well
                          as denial-of-service attacks using open-source tools such as Backtrack</p>

                        <p>The tools implemented in this experiment were not sophisticated or difficult to acquire.
                          However, this alone highlights the
                          lack of security currently being implemented in these devices.</p>

                        <p>A brute force attack that targeted the Wi-Fi and a denial-of-service attack rendering the
                          unit inoperable were used to
                          demonstrate the vulnerability of the medical
                          mannequin. A Denial of service (DOS) attack is designed to shut down or make the target
                          unusable. This is accomplished
                          by flooding the target with a large amount of data that the device cannot handle, causing it
                          to become unresponsive.</p>

                        <p>There are several ways to mitigate brute force attacks, such as changing passwords
                          frequently, increasing password length,
                          limiting login attempts, and
                          implementing multifactor authentication. A proactive approach would be setting up alerts for
                          brute force attacks and
                          monitoring and stopping them before they
                          are fully deployed (Varonis, 2021).</p>

                        <p>DOS attacks can be prevented by proactively monitoring a system for any unusual activity by
                          creating a baseline. In addition
                          to this monitoring, an effective method could also be to implement a VPN with MFA required to
                          access the medical device
                          (Phoenixnapp,2018). Over the years, medical devices have gone from being utterly non-connected
                          to being both wirelessly
                          and software controlled. It's worth bearing in mind that there is an international standard to
                          which medical devices must
                          certify; The IEC 62304 Medical device software, which was put in place to prevent
                          cyber-criminal events on medical devices.
                          However, the standard has not been updated to consider and include either network connectivity
                          or cybersecurity
                          (Williams, Woolward, 2015). When medical device manufacturers are required by law to implement
                          strict security measures
                          into the lifecycle of their products, we will likely see the threats above, and
                          vulnerabilities decrease.</p>

                        <p>Hello, Samuel; very interesting summarization you wrote on the inadequate security measures
                          on
                          the istan medical mannequin. But we should not only concentrate on the software and network
                          leaving the human factor or physical security.</p>
                        <p>Medical mannequin simulation can be a valuable tool in educating the healthcare system in
                          patient-safety space as it is crucial. Cyber breaches in the medical area can lead to data
                          loss
                          of sensitive and confidential data and risk patients’ lives. This is a new reality As more and
                          more systems become automated and data-reliant. Cybersecurity threats in the medical systems
                          have been systematic in data breaches of protected health information. Modern medicine heavily
                          depends on technology, and this means that medical staff must be prepared to deal with
                          cyber-attacks. (Yaacoub et al., 2020)
                        <p>
                        <p>Intrusions and data breaches are likely to increase against medical infrastructure. Sadly,
                          most medical
                          staff lack cyber-security training to detect and respond to cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity
                          training is
                          vital. An effective awareness training program addresses the cybersecurity mistakes medical
                          staff may
                          make when using medical devices. Both the Medical professionals and the Incident responders
                          must
                          have the knowledge and expertise they need to be effective in crisis in a field where
                          conditions
                          are on the ground constantly change. Cybersecurity defenders must consistently be prepared to
                          defend
                          against coordinated networks of bad actors. And without trained cybersecurity professionals
                          who can
                          combat these ever-changing threats, physical damages will inevitably occur, and human lives
                          will be
                          lost due to cyberattacks. (Information Resources Management Association, 2012)</p>

                        <p> Hi Samuel,
                        <p> What a great insight into international standards to which medical devices must certify. As
                          you
                          rightly mentioned, it is quite unfortunate that the standards have not been updated to
                          consider
                          and include either network connectivity or cyber security. Also, note that some of the
                          sanctions
                          and penalties for non-compliance need to be updated.</p>
                        <p>Looking at some of the standards and penalties regarding medical equipment and Cybercrime,
                          you
                          will also agree that they are not in phase with the recent spate of cybercrime. In the USA,
                          for
                          instance, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides guidance to help medical device
                          manufacturers
                          design and maintain cyber security products. It also protects patients' interests by urging
                          manufacturers to monitor and assess cyber security vulnerability risks and proactively
                          disclose
                          vulnerabilities and solutions to address them (The U.S Food & Drug Administration, 2020).</p>
                        <p>In other countries like Australia, where there are identified Cyber security vulnerabilities,
                          threats and risks that pose an immediate and significant threat to the health and safety of
                          users, or if there is an indication that there is actual or potential product tampering, such
                          devices may require an immediate recall (Australian Government, 2021).</p>
                        <p> In England and Wales, The computer misuse Act of 1990 noted that it is an offence to cause a
                          computer to perform any function with the intent to secure unauthorised access to any program
                          or data.
                          For Example, Hacking or unauthorised access attracts a maximum penalty of 2 years. If the
                          crime
                          further aggravates to theft, the penalty is five years of Imprisonment (ICLG.com, N.D)</p>
                        <p>These examples and many others show that there are existing guiding regulatory checks for
                          Cyber security
                          incidences for medical equipment; however, the changing landscape of Cybercrime and the
                          increased
                          connectedness of medical devices have given rise to more vulnerabilities. According to the
                          2022 State
                          of Healthcare IoT Device Security Report from Cynerio, 53% of internet-connected medical
                          devices
                          analysed were found to have a known vulnerability, while one-third of bedside devices were
                          identified
                          to have a critical risk (Murray, A. (2022).</p>
                        <p> Recent attacks can be seen in 2021. Cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment in East
                          Greenwich
                          had their appointments moved due to a software outage caused by a cyber-attack on an outside
                          vendor
                          (Shaun Towne, Kait Walsh, Chelsea Jones 2021). In December 2021, a ransomware attack on the
                          Maryland
                          State Department of Health affected the COVID-19 response in the state for that month. Access
                          critical
                          databases for communicable diseases, lab reports, and more (Greig, J. (2022).</p>
                        <p> Therefore, it is evident that the existing standards and regulatory checks are not creating
                          the needed
                          impact to curtail cybercrime on medical equipment. A much more ardent and stricter standard
                          and
                          regulatory sanctions need to be put in place to strengthen the current security solutions
                          provided
                          for Medical equipment.</p>

                        <h4> Hi Isioma</h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>As rightly pointed out Isioma, medical systems are also considered IoT systems. IoT, while
                          influential and beneficial, introduces
                          several security issues. IoT's key risks include network vulnerabilities and outdated software
                          and firmware (Shea, 2021).
                          they often are produced with Weak or hardcoded passwords. By default, attackers may already
                          know the device's password.
                          Usually, passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot be changed, and are
                          vulnerable to credential theft.
                          One notable example of such an attack is Mirai malware. The Lack of an update process or
                          mechanism.</p>

                        <p>Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and
                          connectivity. Unfortunately, when
                          hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or bugs, they become vulnerable even if they are
                          secure at purchase. Over time,
                          IoT devices become exposed if regular updates are not applied (Thales, 2021).</p>

                        <p>In addition to the mitigative measures, you have already stated in this discussion. To
                          mitigate the risks associated with this
                          device, manufacturers of the mannequin should consider policies such as password complexity,
                          password expiration, account
                          lockout, and one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when setting up the
                          device.</p>

                        <p>Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the
                          likelihood of IoT attacks. Only signed
                          updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for authenticity when applying updates
                          (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>By disabling WPS, the mannequin can't easily connect to the network, making it more
                          vulnerable.
                          The WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a wireless network security standard that makes connections
                          between a router and wireless devices (mannequins) faster and easier. Wireless Protected Setup
                          is a key exchange mechanism rather than a security mechanism. It facilitates connections
                          between
                          devices and access points and is one of the vulnerable points of a network.</p>
                        <p>WPS works with WPA/WPA2/PSK and allows devices to establish connections to WLANs. Utilizing
                          the
                          following methods</p>
                        <li>
                          <p>PIN: Entering a PIN on the device</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Push-button: A physical or virtual push-button should be pressed on both the access point
                            and the
                            client device during the connection phase.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>NFC: To use Near Field Communication, the client must bring their device close to the
                            access point.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>USB drive: Necessary connection information exchange between an access point and a device
                            is done
                            using a USB drive.</p>
                        </li>
                        <p>The short length of WPS PINs and the fact that both PIN parts are validated separately means
                          that an
                          online brute force attack on the PIN can be made within several hours, allowing an attacker to
                          access
                          a WLAN (mannequin device).
                          Wireless LAN clients can authenticate their users and ensure user confidentiality through WPA
                          or WPA2.
                          WPA is vulnerable to the offline dictionary attack since the information required to create
                          and verify
                          a session key is broadcasted (Noureddine
                          Boudriga, 2019, p.270) Using WPA2/enterprise security and mutual client and server
                          authentication
                          provides the most secure and protected wireless network compared to the WPA and WEP.

                            researching ways to mitigate the vulnerabilities discussed in the paper on the Medical
                            Mannequin
                            vulnerabilities. I think the task has allowed me to improve my research and information
                            synthesis
                            skills, also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                            The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on
                            teamwork, which
                            is quite interesting to collaborate with other peers to achieve a common goal.
                            We were to complete the Team Contract. We did this with utmost simplicity and came up with
                            our team leader.

                                <li>1. We reviewed an NMAP scan of our website and discussed the vulnerabilities of open
                                  ports to be added to the assignment</li>
                              </p>

                                <li>3. Beth is going to format the assignment as a report to include contents and
                                  headings and add a DREAD analysis to the
                                  table - the group will then discuss the risk ratings and agree on the order of

                              <p>1. How many hops from my machine to the assigned website, I used tracert and found out
                                that there are 12 hops
                                from my laptop to the website. Shown below in the Pic

                                that delay? It was observed
                                that the 6th step caused the biggest delay with the request time out
                              </p>
                              <p>3. What are the main nameservers for the website? I used an open-source to find out the
                                nameservers for the website.
                                https://whois.domaintools.com/ ; as shown in the pic1 & 2 below, there are four name

                              <p>6. Where is the website hosted? To find out where the website is hosted, I used
                                Geolocation, since I have obtained
                                the IP address from the MX lookup and was able to see that its hosting ISP is in the
                                United States of America in ANN Arbor city.

                            </p>
                            <p>Security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is an ongoing problem. In today's
                              hyper-connected world, security attacks are a reality. Beran points out that
                              a recent Deloitte (2018) report projects that nearly 70% of medical devices
                              will be connected to networks by 2025 (Necat, 2022). Health care products are
                              becoming increasingly connected, and cyber-attacks are becoming more powerful
                              and ingenious, so the threat of cyber-attacks is escalating dramatically. The
                              stakes are high, from revenue losses to product recalls to patient safety and
                              brand damage; or worse, a regulatory body could shut down business operations.
                              In addition, there are the "unknown risks"--cyber vulnerabilities that are
                              ignored due to insufficient forethought or expertise.</p>

                            <p>According to Isioma (Okafor Tolofari, 2022), human factors contribute to cybersecurity
                              breaches. The IoT device like the mannequin can be exploited because of various factors,
                              such as a lack of awareness, negligence, or incorrect access control.</p>

                            <p>Jurbe shed more light on the different regulatory bodies that are poised in ensuring the
                              implementation of security in the production of these medical devices that are connected
                              to the network from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides guidance to help
                              medical devices manufacturers design and maintain products that are cyber secured in
                              the USA, to the computer misuse Act of 1990, which acknowledged that it is an offence
                              to cause a computer to perform any function with the intent to secure unauthorized access
                              to any program or data in England and Wales (Jubet,2022)

                            <p>My initial post described the IEC 62304 regulation on functional safety, which covers
                              software
                              design and maintenance. This regulation describes processes, activities, and tasks to
                              ensure
                              software safety. In medical device software development and maintenance, the software is
                              itself
                              a medical device.</p>

                            <p>There are many security recommendations for IoT devices, including biometrics and
                              two-factor
                              authorization, but blockchain-based IoT security might be the best solution for the
                              largely
                              unregulated IoT market. IoT security may be enhanced by blockchain, which is most famous
                              for bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain technology provides strong protection against data
                              tampering, limiting access to the Internet of Things devices, and removing compromised
                              devices
                              from an IoT network.</p>

                            <p>Regulations related to the use and development of IoT will continue to evolve as they
                              advance.
                              IoT security system on the blockchain is, however, something that seems very promising.

                            <p>In Unit 3, we scanned the website assigned to our group and discussed the results.
                              We also had to submit our final post on medical mannequin vulnerabilities and prepared
                              for the seminar for next week on TCP/IP and ISO/OSI 7 layer internet protocols.
                              The article on Medical Mannequins (Glisson, 2015) has given me a clear idea of what I
                              wanted to say in my final discussion forum post. Peer contributions helped to clarified
                              some
                              points that I had initially misunderstood.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the 3-week
                              discussion has improved my ability to locate relevant information security information
                              from various sources.
                              Conversely, I found the individual scans we had to do on the website assigned to us
                              more challenging. Since I have no experience with the command prompt,
                              I have enjoyed preparing for the next seminar in Unit 4. The article we
                              had to read has showcased the other side of information technology and demonstrated how
                              the very early applications of the Agile method helped TCP/IP network protocol become
                              the leading one over the ISO/OSI protocol.</p>
                            <p> we were able to achieve our unit learning goals of expressing
                              basic network concepts and performing basic network troubleshooting throughout the tasks
                              we had this week.

                                the 6th step caused the biggest delay with the request time out

                                Mxtoolbox and was able to get the DNS
                                record, the IP address as 68.66.247.187</li>

                              <li>6. Where is the website hosted? To find out where the website is hosted, I used
                                Geolocation, since I have obtained the
                                IP address from the MX lookup and was able to see that its hosting ISP is in the United
                                States of America in ANN Arbor city.</li>

                            <p>we are required to read: Russell, A.L. (2006) ‘Rough Consensus and Running Code’ and the
                              Internet-OSI Standards

                            <p>Then consider the following:</p>

                            <p>“Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer
                              model rather than TCP/IP? “</p>
                            <p>Both models have advantages and disadvantages. The OSI model should be preferred over the
                              TCP/IP approach if appropriate documentation, specification, and modularisation are
                              essential. However, if the network's implementation, stability, and security are more
                              critical, the TCP/IP model should be implemented</p>

                            <p>1.Reference Model: Both the OSI and the TCP/IP are reference models.</p>
                            <p>2.Layered Architecture: Both the OSI and TCP/IP models have a layered architecture,
                              with the OSI model having7 layers while the TCP/IP has five layers.</p>
                            <p>3.Each layer provides different functionalities in the network.</p>
                            <p>4.Protocols: Both the OSI and the TCP/IP model use different protocols in different
                              layers
                              for the proper implementation of the model over the network.</p>
                            <p>5.Functionalities: The OSI and the TCP/IP model layers provide approximately the same
                              functionality.</p>

                            <h4><b>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OSI AND THE TCP/IP MODEL</b></h4>
                            </p>


                            <p>1.Evolution: The OSI model evolved as a logical and conceptual model. The TCP/IP model is
                              implemented first with the specified protocols and then documented. So, if someone needs
                              the theoretical aspects of the model, they should go with the OSI model. But if someone
                              wants to implement the model practically - use the TCP-IP model.</p>
                            <p>2.Objective: The OSI model's goal is to create a generic standard for describing
                              connection
                              methods, layered architecture, services, interfaces, and protocols. The TCP/IP model, on
                              the other hand, strives to provide a secure and end-to-end transmission model. The OSI
                              model should be used if a generic and standard model is required. However, the TCP/IP
                              paradigm should be chosen if network stability and security are needed.</p>
                            <p>3.Area Focused: The OSI model is a generic model that is hence universal. It can be
                              utilised in various sorts of networks according to the standards. The TCP/IP model, on
                              the other hand, is protocol-based and compatible with existing Internet architecture.
                              The OSI Model should be used if someone needs a universal model that can be applied to
                              various networks.</p>
                            <p>4.Documentation: The OSI model specifies the three central concepts of services,
                              interfaces,
                              and protocols. The TCP/IP model is not so clear. So, if someone needs documentation and
                              guidance while implementing the network, they should refer to the OSI model.</p>
                            <p>5.Set-up and Configuration: The OSI model is simple to set up and configure because it
                              is a generic model. The TCP/IP approach, on the other hand, is complicated since it is
                              only compatible with certain types of networks. So, the OSI model is superior when it
                              comes to network setup and configuration.</p>
                            <p>6.Modularity: If someone focuses on a more modular network with proper functionalities,
                              they should go for the TCP/IP model. Both models are modular, but the OSI model has
                              more layers (7) than the TCP-IP model(5 layers).</p>
                            <p>7.Replacing Protocols: The OSI model is a protocol-independent model which allows us
                              to implement our protocols as per our needs. On the other hand, the TCP/IP model is
                              protocol dependent and defines a specific set of protocols for implementing the model.
                              It is very complex to make changes or replace some protocols in the TCP / IP model.
                              So, if someone needs the specified set of protocols, they should go with the original
                              model.</p>
                            <p>8.Data Delivery: In the OSI model, the transport layer facilitates the
                              connection-oriented
                              transfer, and hence it guarantees the delivery of packets. Data delivery is the
                              functionality of the Transport layer in both models. So, we can use the OSI model if we
                              want to guarantee the proper data delivery over the network.</p>
                            <p>9.Reliable and Secure Connection: The OSI model does not have any special mechanism for
                              providing a reliable and secure connection for data transmission. On the other hand,
                              the TCP/IP model has a 3-way handshake mechanism to provide a safe and dependable
                              connection link.</p>

                              <p>In my initial post, I elaborated on the results obtained from the task asked to
                                perform
                                some basic scans on my group assigned website, “Allmytype.co.uk,” which we did
                                individually
                                and later collaborated on the result in our group sessions. The scan aimed to find out
                                basic information about the website, like the primary nameservers for the website, who
                                is
                                the registered contact, where it is hosted, the hops from my machine to the assigned
                                website
                                and which step caused the most significant delay.</p>

                              <p>The results were obtained as denoted in the initial post by using my command prompt
                                to get
                                the website’s route, then using open-source tools to find out the rest of the asked
                                information.

                                During the peer responses, Ange asked a fundamental and intuitive question about
                                considering
                                the router naming convention where many routers use city names and airport codes to
                                describe
                                they are actual locations if I was still going to have the same result (Angelides,
                                2022).
                                It is a yes as these tools are quite dependable, especially when it is being done
                                using
                                various before concluding, and there are standards that indeed regulate how these
                                results are
                                put out.</p>

                              <p>Andrijana related how the quality of the ISP, the internet connection firewall
                                configurations,
                                and geographical locations all affect the routing. High latency in the middle that is
                                consistent
                                is not an issue. Still, there will be an issue when an increase in the latency towards
                                the target
                                or an increase in the latency at the beginning, which he related as could be an issue
                                on the local
                                network (Klacar, 2022).

                              <p>Geolocation services based on IP can only provide an approximate measurement of
                                geolocation accuracy.
                                These services provide 95 per cent to 99 per cent accuracy in a user's country. An

                                service provides 55 per cent to 80 per cent accuracy for a user's location. For
                                cities, they provide 50
                                per cent to 75 per cent accuracy. As a result, accuracy may differ from provider to
                                provider and location
                                to location (If-So Dynamic Content, 2019).</p>

                                (Thia & Hieu, 2019). This is vital to prevent an attack that could compromise the

                              <p>GDPR requires data protection by design; in order to meet this requirement, the
                                website must be built with
                                security features and take into consideration vulnerabilities that could impact the
                                personal data stored on
                                the site. Threat modelling should be completed for critical authentication, access
                                control, business logic,
                                and key flows and plausibility checks integrated at each tier of the application
                                (OWASP, 2021).
                                The OWASP (2021) top 10 vulnerabilities can be used to advise on the highest security
                                risks to web
                                applications and should be a focus when designing any site that holds personal
                                information. Applying
                                mitigating actions against each vulnerability can protect an organisation from GDPR

                              <p>In Unit 6, We published our summary post on the basic scans we had to perform
                                in Unit 3 and submitted the Design document and individual peer reviews.
                                Teamwork has been the most challenging part of this unit and the module overall.
                                People pick up tasks voluntarily.</p>
                              <p>This week, we have also had to submit our summary post in the discussion forum.
                                I found this part hard.</p>
                              <p> However, our Group 2 Initial post has attracted a lot of attention which is the
                                whole point of these forums. Some of us can learn from our peer findings, and it
                                is a more informal way of receiving feedback on your work instead of having your
                                tutor evaluate each workpiece.</p>
                              <p>Overall, I do feel like my knowledge has grown on vulnerability scanning. I am
                                gaining practical experience reviewing the network and obtaining relevant
                                information necessary to derive the vulnerabilities. I am becoming more confident
                                in applying the theoretical vulnerability assessments, such as STRIDE, to given
                                case studies, such as our assigned website. I now also have a deeper understanding
                                of TCIP/IP protocols. My research skills have also improved, and with all the
                                knowledge I have gained so far.</p>

                                on each.
                                Leroux, S. (2020) The Kali Linux Review </p>
                              <p>Bhatt, D. (2018) Modern Day Penetration Testing Distribution Open-Source
                                Platform - Kali Linux - Study Paper. International Journal of Scientific & Technology
                                Research 7(4): 233-237.</p>
                              <p>The first two articles on Kali Linux (Leroux, 2020; Bhatt, 2018) insight into how to
                                use the security tools suite and the considerations each new user must make before using
                                it.</p>
                              <p>
                              <h4><b>The following three questions were then asked:</b></h4>
                              </p>

                              <p>
                              <h4><b>1. What does the article teach you about conducting vulnerability scans using
                                  Kali?</b></h4>
                              </p>

                              <p>A. Both articles highlight the importance of a virtual machine over the host machine to
                                have a controlled environment if there is malware so it will not affect the entire home
                                network.</p>

                              <p>B.Both articles gave suggestions on different ways Kali Linux can be used. You could
                                download
                                a ready to use Debian based Kali Linux and set it up as a virtual machine, or create a
                                Debian based virtual machine and install Kali Linux tools on it as you need it.</p>

                              <p>C. The Leroux (2020) article also advises against installing additional applications on
                                readymade Debian based Kali Linux since they would most likely come from not
                                authenticated
                                sources.</p>

                              <p>D. The latter article also reminded the reader that Kali Linux only runs one root user,
                                so
                                the tester must be careful to not corrupt important system files because of those
                                superuser

                              <p>F. The article by Bhatt (2018) provides some examples of how to use the Dmitry and
                                Metasploit tools.</p>
                              <p>
                              <h4><b>2.What issues might you encounter?</b></h4>
                              </p>
                              Lack of knowledge of Linux OS and learning the commands.
                              <p>
                              <h4><b>3.How would you overcome them?</b></h4>
                              </p>
                              <p>To use Kali Linux, I will have to do much independent research and practice.
                                Then we were asked to read a paper by Bhingardeve & Franklin (2018), which compares pen
                                test
                                tools available, and to answer the following two questions:</p>
                              <p>1. How do their results compare with your initial evaluation?
                                My initial review aligns with the author’s as Nmap is easier to use and well documented.
                                Then Metasploit with SQLMap being the least as it is limited.</p>

                              <p>However, when we discussed these tools with the team, all three got the same total
                                score. </p>

                              <p>
                              <h4><b>What do you think of their criteria?</b></h4>
                              </p>

                              <p>I think the criteria such as Powerful is very subjective. For example, the SQL map may
                                not be
                                a very versatile tool, but it does a great job at automated SQL injection testing, and
                                so,
                                when it comes to these types of attacks, should it not be flagged as powerful?</p>

                              <p> In my opinion, Acclaimed and Popular are very similar and could have been combined
                                into one
                                instead of two criteria. As a result, I am unsure how the authors judged the Popularity
                                and
                                Acclaim of a tool.?</p>
                              <p>
                                Ultimately, how easy is it to use something is very subjective, and to someone with no
                                or
                                limited security knowledge, all these tools could be challenging to use.
                                We were then asked to consider all we have learned so far and the articles/papers we
                                have
                                been asked to read and to answer two more questions:?</p>
                              <p>1. What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs Nessus?</p>

                              <p>Kali is an open-source, free tool, while Nessus is a paid scanner, although a basic
                                version
                                of Nessus can be downloaded for free. Kali offers over 600 free security tools, whereas
                                the
                                free version of Nessus offers just a few basic features.</p>

                              <p>Nessus generates scan reports in a nice format for the user (Said, 2020), whereas many
                                Kali
                                tools do not do it.</p>

                              <p>Nessus also has an excellent graphic user interface, making it new and user-friendly.
                              <p>
                              <h4>1. Has this changed your original evaluation score?</p>
                              </h4>

                              <p>I initially rated Kali Linux lower on ease of use because, being a Linux based
                                pen-testing
                                suite, it creates a learning curve for those without previous Linux experience.
                                Additionally,
                                I rated it lower for its ease of installation.</p>

                              <p>After reading these articles, the tool is easily installed via the readily available
                                packages,
                                and instructions for running different commands are available online. Hence, I think the
                                score
                                would be higher in those two categories.</p>

                              <p>I had initially given very high marks to the Nessus scanner, and it had the same
                                overall score
                                as Kali Linux. In my opinion, I would keep the score the same for Nessus, which is now
                                slightly
                                below Kali Linux, just because to get most of the tools, you would have to pay.</p>

                              <p>I have performed various scans on our assigned website allmytype.co.uk using Kali
                                Linux.</p>
                              Readily available Kali Linux package powered by Debian (64bit) was used and installed as a
                              VM
                              on a Virtual box. In addition, I used ProtonVpn during all of my scans.
                              <p>The following scanning tasks were addressed.</p>
                              <p>
                              <h4><b>What OS does the website utilise?</b></h4>
                              </p>
                              <p>I used the OS fingerprinting provided by Nmap to find out the details on the OS and the
                                command nmap -O [IP address].</p>
                              <p>Nmap could not locate one open and one closed port (there were only open ports
                                available
                                at the time of the scan) and so accurate results could not be returned, only the best
                                estimate as below (or aggressive OS guesses, as Nmap calls it):</p>

                              Running the command wafw00f allmytype.co.uk told me that it uses imunify360 (CloudLinux)
                              Web Application Firewall.

                              <p>I used the URLextractor tool for this and the command ./extractor.sh allmytype.co.uk.
                                The scan confirmed that the web server is hosted in Michigan Ann Arbor US.</p>

                              <p>I used Nmap to scan for open ports. I scanned up to 7000 open ports using the command
                                below and the scan returned
                                7000 tcp open ports. It appears the website has many open ports.</p>

                            <p>In unit 7 we were asked to conduct an e-portfolio activity, prepare for the unit
                              8 seminar and to perform a scanning exercise using Kali Linux.
                            <p>The e-portfolio activity was a straightforward task. We were asked to read various
                              papers discussing the benefits and disadvantages of Kali Linux, then to answer
                              questions such as 'What have you learned?' and asked to reconsider our individual
                              (and team) scores given to this tool in the earlier units. The articles and papers
                              were informative and have cleared up some questions I had in the earlier units when
                              I had to score Kali Linux. I think I would make a better-informed decision this time
                              around.</p>
                            <p>The Kali Linux scanning activity, on the other hand, was a lot more complex. I had
                              trouble with Kali Linux installations.</p>

                            <p>I enjoyed the scans themselves and having a chance to learn hands-on how the
                              vulnerability
                              detection and information gathering cyber security phases work.</p>

                            <p>In this unit, we have also touched on Business Continuity and Data Recovery strategies
                              This
                              has once again showed me how far cyber security stretches and how many different areas it
                              impacts. It highlights that a good specialist would not only consider the technical
                              aspects,
                              such as running scanners, pen test tools, patching the systems, but also would be able to
                              conduct risk assessments, contribute towards the business continuity and data recovery
                              policies.

                        <p>My case study is 'Publication of personal information - journalistic exemption' (Data
                          Protection Commission, 2017),
                          which examined a situation involving an article published in the Sunday World (in both
                          newspaper and online news
                          forms) that named the complainant and published their photograph. According to the
                          complainant, the Sunday World
                          obtained unauthorised access to their personal data from the Irish Prison Service.</p>
                        <p>The Sunday World relied on the journalistic exemption provision under Section 22A of the
                          Data Protection
                          Acts 1988 & 2003 (the Acts) in relation to the obtaining of the information in relation to
                          the “Category A”
                          complaints and the complainant’s personal data.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, under Section 22A, the Acts state that personal data that is processed only
                          for journalistic purposes
                          shall be exempt from certain requirements of those laws (such as a legal basis
                          requirement) if three cumulative
                          criteria are met.</p>
                        <p>However, while the Commission considered the Sunday World to have a legitimate interest
                          in gathering and processing
                          statistical information regarding 'Category A' complaints for the purpose of research for
                          the article in question,
                          she ruled that the media organization had violated Section 2(1)(c)(iii) by publishing the
                          complainant's personal
                          information.

                        <p>In this review of the publication of personal information - journalistic exemption, The
                          Data
                          Protection Act of 1988 and 2003 recognises that public interest in free expression and
                          information is a matter of particular concern and allows exemptions for the publication of
                          journalistic, literary, artistic, and academic works where there is a reasonable belief
                          that
                          publication is in the public interest and compliance would be incompatible with the
                          purposes
                          of the work (Glanville, 2018). The data controller must demonstrate that to be exempted
                          from
                          publishing personal data under section 22A of the ACT. Personal data that is processed
                          only
                          for the purposes specified in this subsection is exempt if:</p>
                        <p>
                          (a)the processing is performed to publish any journalistic, literary, or artistic material
                          by a person,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          (b) considers that the public interest in freedom of expression is of particular
                          importance, and the data
                          controller reasonably believes publication would be in the public interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          (c) based on all the circumstances, the controller believes compliance with that provision
                          is incompatible
                          with the purposes (The National Archives, 2022).
                        </p>

                        <p>This case shows that section 22A of the Acts does not grant absolute immunity that can be
                          routinely invoked
                          to justify publishing unnecessary personal data by publishers and journalists alike. Even
                          though the
                          Commission considered that the Sunday World had a legitimate interest in obtaining and
                          processing information
                          concerning the complainant” prisoner”, it did not feel that identifying them by name or
                          photograph would
                          further enhance or diminish the public interest (Case Studies |Data Protection Commission,
                          n.d.).</p>
                        <p>By publishing the complainant's information as research for the article in question, she
                          considered the Sunday
                          World to have contravened Section 2(1)(c). The Sunday World's misuse of the system led to
                          this contravention
                          since excessive processing of the data by publication was not needed to illustrate the
                          point.</p>

                        <p>Unit 8 was all about GDPR, case studies and analysis of these case studies. I enjoyed
                          reading the real-life scenarios of the companies that failed to implement the GDPR
                          regulations correctly and while preparing the initial discussion forum post on the
                          case study I have chosen.</p>
                        <p> The interesting thing about these case studies is that the
                          companies believed they had everything in place to meet GDPR requirements, but when
                          the investigation got under way, it became apparent that their interpretations of the
                          requirements weren't entirely accurate. The GDPR leaves a lot of room for interpretation
                          so this is the main concern for most businesses.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, companies should consider reviewing case studies on an annual basis to
                          ensure their policies will stand strong if they are investigated.</p>

                        <p> Beth shared a Template for the Executive summary and gave a brief description of the

                        <p> Vina complained about her inability to access the site allmytype.co.uk on a few occasions
                          while trying to perform scans.</p>
                        <p>Samuel pointed out that the Nikto scan done by Vina in the last exercise can suffice for
                          the vulnerability identification of the site allmytype.co.uk. The scan featured open
                          port vulnerabilities, no HTTP X-XSS-Protection etc.</p>
                        <p> The Team agreed to base the Executive summary on the Design document submitted in
                          Unit 6 and scanning activity in Unit 7</p>
                        <p>The design document in Unit 6 has highlighted most of the Vulnerabilities identified
                          during the scanning of the website allmytype.co.uk. The scanning Exercise in Unit
                          It was agreed that this exercise would focus more on summarising the vulnerabilities
                          identified in the last activity and the tools used to identify these vulnerabilities
                          with justification for using these tools. Not all vulnerabilities will be included.
                          However, an explanation will be provided for that.</p>
                        <p>The Vulnerabilities identified will be categorised. For example, vulnerabilities like
                          open ports already placed in the last Exercise will be treated under Security
                          Misconfiguration,
                          and improper error handling also is under Security misconfiguration.</p>

                        <p> Samuel further shared a brief description of improper Error handling, highlighting a
                          scenario where wrongly imputed login passwords do not display the correct error messages
                          even after multiple tries.</p>

                        <p>It was also noted that the tools used in the last exercise were Kali Linux, Nmap, Nikto,
                          and Dmitry; hence we will base our summaries on these tools.</p>
                        <p> Jubet noted that the Exercise recommended presenting results in graphics and charts.
                          The Team agreed to generate graphs that represent a comparative analysis of the tools
                          used for the scanning exercise in Unit 6 </p>
                        <p> Also, to generate graphs that will show comparative analysis for the vulnerabilities
                          identified in the previous exercise through pie charts etc. The goal is to rate these
                          vulnerabilities based on their assessed risk to the site allmytype.co.uk.
                          Beth also discussed how the results of the DREAD analysis in the previous exercise
                          would also be represented graphically.</p>
                        <p> Samuel urged the team to regularly update the Template shared by Beth to avoid a
                          last-minute rush, which was unanimously agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>The team deliberated on the previous rating and ways to achieve better results in
                          the coming Exercise.</p>
                        <p> The next meeting will hold on 15th May 2022 at 1600HRS GMT
                          The meeting ended at 1935HRS GMT</p>

                        <p>This was an interesting read.</p>

                        <p>This brings in focus, the importance of proper interpretation of the GDPR privacy laws.
                          Had there been a proper impact assessment of the GDPR privacy law in this publication
                          vis-à-vis related guidance like the journalistic exemption, such infringement would
                          have been prevented. Data protection Impact assessment(DPIA) helps to identify and
                          minimise data protection risks(Information Commissioner's Office,2019). It is good
                          practice to carry out a DPIA for any project which requires the processing of personal
                          data by first describing the nature, scope, context, purposes of the processing, its
                          necessity, proportionality and compliance measures. Also identifying and assessing the
                          risks to individuals, and then putting in place any additional measure to mitigate these
                          risks(Information Commissioner's Office,2019). The Sunday World apparently did not carry
                          out an impact assessment to properly identify where certain practices can infringe on
                          related privacy laws. The impact of publishing the name and photograph of the prisoner
                          in such a publication, with respect to public interest, would have been properly assessed,
                          and it would have been clear that there was no need retrieving the personal data of the
                          prisoner, let alone publish it online.</p>

                        </p>

                        <p><b>Hello Samuel, just to add an insight </p></b>


                        <p>The UK General Data Protection Regulation (UKGDPR) protects personal

                          data and the right to freedom of expression, including for processing for

                          journalistic purposes. Under the Art. 85 GDPR Processing and

                          freedom of expression and information.</p>



                        <p>This guide advises on good practice and clarifies how an exemption for journalism works to
                          protect freedom of expression.

                          This section gives an overview of the Data Protection Act (DPA), with more detail on how we
                          interpret the underlying legal
                          provisions. It is aimed primarily at media organisations and freelance journalists. However,
                          the ICO must consider the
                          importance of freedom of expression when deciding how best to use its powers in the public
                          interest.

                        <p>As is indicated in Art. 30(5) GDPR. In practice, this exemption is rarely applicable. Apart
                          from any difficulties that
                          occur during interpreting what is considered “only occasional,” in most cases – even with a
                          broad understanding of the
                          term – data will unambiguously be processed regularly.</p>



                        <p>The processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes should be subject to
                          derogations or exemptions from
                          certain provisions of this Regulation(“Art. 85 GDPR – Processing and Freedom of Expression

                        <h4><b>MY Peer Response TO Isioma Vina Okafor-Tolofari INITIAL POST</b></h4>


                        <p>In this review, Isioma points out that the educational organisation violated Section 4 of
                          the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 by failing to provide the complainant with the data
                          within the statutory 40-day period.</p>

                        <p>In the above case, the data subject’s right of access was severely delayed as there is no
                          justification for such a lengthy delay in any circumstances. Such a delay is particularly
                          unacceptable in a situation where the requester sought a copy of personal data contained
                          in the CCTV footage. The data controller is aware of the Data Protection Acts and regularly
                          receives and processes subject access requests.</p>

                        <p>Among the many complaints that arise in connection with the access requests is the data
                          controller’s lateness in processing the request. According to the Data Protection Acts,
                          an access request must be responded to within 40 days, and if this deadline is not met,
                          as in the case described above, the data controller violates the Acts. The Office of
                          the Data Protection Commissioner is very concerned about the prevalence of this
                          infringement. In some instances, the data controller fails to acknowledge receiving the
                          access request within 40 days. This means that the requester has no idea whether their
                          access request is being dealt with or ignored. A common theme emerges in many of these
                          complaints’ lateness on the data controller’s part in processing the access request.
                          The Acts lay down 40 days for compliance with an access request, and if this is not met,
                          as in the case outlined above, the data controller contravenes the Data Protection Acts.</p>

                        <p>Unit 9 has been very informative on the subject of SIEM tools, various security threats,
                          digital forensics, logs and various logging tools.</p>

                        <p>In this unit, we were introduced to various types of logs within the UNIX and Windows
                          systems,
                          various tools which could be used to read, synthesise and analyse logs.</p>

                        <p>Logging is a crucial component of cybersecurity, especially in detecting early threats
                          because
                          cyber attacks often leave behind footprints that can be found in logs. In the event an
                          attack
                          occurs over an extended period of time, the logs can be used to uncover and possibly prevent
                          it.
                          If the cyber attack has already happened, the cyber attack pattern in the logs can help
                          improve
                          existing tools which use logs to identify attacks to ensure other businesses can prevent
                          such incidents.</p>

                        <p>Digital forensics , its purpose, the techniques and tools applied was part of this unit
                          studies.

                        <p>In this unit we have also touched upon the 'to do list' of a breach, i.e. the action plan
                          of a
                          business which should be followed when the data breach is discovered. We then applied this
                          theoretical
                          plan on our chosen data breach which had happened in the real world.</p>

                        <p>We have also continued working on the Unit 11 assignment. This week our goal as a team was
                          to

                          <p>In my initial review of the publication of personal information - journalistic exemption,
                            where I highlighted the Data Protection Act of 1988 and 2003 recognition, that public
                            interest in free expression and information is a matter of particular concern and allows
                            exemptions for the publication of journalistic, literary, artistic, and academic works
                            where there is a reasonable belief that the publication is in the public interest and
                            compliance would be incompatible with the purposes of the work (Glanville, 2018).
                            Section 22A of the Data Protection Act allows exemptions for publishing journalistic,
                            literary, artistic, and academic works with a reasonable belief that publication is in
                            the public interest. The Sunday World's misuse of the system led to this contravention
                            since excessive processing of the data by the magazine was not needed to illustrate the
                            point. This case shows that section 22A does not grant absolute immunity that can be
                            routinely invoked to justify publishing unnecessary personal data by publishers and
                            journalists alike.</p>

                          <p>As pointed out by Jurbe, the Sunday World published the name and photograph of a
                            prisoner,
                            with the personal data of the prisoner. This highlights the importance of proper
                            interpretation of the GDPR privacy laws. The Sunday World did not conduct an impact
                            assessment
                            to identify where certain practices can infringe on related privacy laws
                            (Information Commissioner's Office,2019) (Jubet, 2022).</p>

                          <p>Highlighted also by Isioma, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UKGDPR) protects
                            personal
                            data and the right to freedom of expression, including for processing for journalistic
                            purposes.
                            Art. 30(5) GDPR – Processing and Freedom of Expression and Information. This guide advises
                            on
                            good practice and clarifies how an exemption for journalism protects free speech. This
                            section
                            gives an overview of the Data Protection Act (DPA), with more detail on how we interpret
                            the
                            underlying legal provisions. As is indicated in Art. 30(5) GDPR (Okafor Tolofari).
                            As illustrated by this case, Section 22A of the Acts' journalistic exemption is not a
                            blanket
                            exemption that publishers or journalists can use to justify revealing excessive personal
                            data.
                            The mere existence of a published article is not enough to qualify for this exemption;
                            instead,
                            a data controller must be able to demonstrate that they meet all three criteria in this
                            section:
                            the processing is carried out solely to publish journalistic, literary, or artistic
                            material; the
                            data controller reasonably believes such publication would be in the public interest, and
                            the
                            data controller has to comply with the relevant requirements(Case Studies | Data

                          <p>In unit 10 we had the summary discussion forum post to submit and new materials to study,
                            and we have started working on our Unit 11 assignment: the Executive summary.</p>
                          <p>I have enjoyed learning more about various types of security breaches. It felt a little
                            like the previous module's revision as we have previously touched upon this topic
                            (the types of breaches); it was helpful to go over it again. The security breach checklist
                            was a new topic from the previous unit, which I found very helpful and something I could
                            see myself implementing in a real-world scenario.</p>
                          <p>The summary post in the discussion forum was posted. I had few responses from my peers on
                            my
                            initial post, so my summary post was more about me reflecting on the thoughts I have
                            received
                            from my initial post.</p>

                          <p>The peer-to-peer system is built on the principle of decentralisation. The blockchain

                            and validate blocks as a distributed peer-to-peer network. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer
                            network-based distributed ledger that tracks one or more digital assets (Avron, 2021).
                            All computers in a peer-to-peer network are linked. Each computer keeps a complete copy
                            of the ledger and compares it to others to assure data accuracy, making it highly

                          <p>Unlike banks, where transactions are privately stored and controlled solely by the banks,
                            a
                            central authority prevents users from being censored by user-to-user blockchain
                            architecture.
                            In addition, unlike conventional bank accounts, virtual currency wallets cannot be frozen
                            or
                            emptied by banks or governments.</p>



                          <p>The other peers are still present because of the P2P networking capability, even if one
                            peer
                            gets
                            down. Thus, nobody can take down the blockchain. It's also very impossible to change the
                            original
                            file because most client hard drives must establish consensus with one another before a
                            transaction
                            can be completed.</p>

                          <p>Immutability is a feature of blockchain, which means that data can't be wiped or replaced
                            after
                            it's been written, traditional databases lack immutability, making them more vulnerable to
                            tampering
                            by a rogue administrator or third-party hackers (Sharma, 2020).</p>

                          <p>With cloud computing, you must rely on AWS and Google Drives. However, with blockchain,
                            because it
                            uses peer-to-peer networking, you do not need to rely on third parties, which can alter
                            your
                            data.
                            Unfortunately, such networks are not immune to censorship by central authorities.</p>



                          <p> When paired with a majority consensus requirement, the distributed peer-to-peer network
                            gives
                            blockchains a relatively high degree of resistance to malicious activity like the
                            Denial-of-Service
                            (DoS) attacks due to its decentralised architecture (Koegel, Hong Heather Yu and Eng Keong
                            Lua, 2009).</p>



                          <p> However, the peer-to-peer nature of blockchain networks creates few concerns.
                            Distributed
                            ledgers must
                            be updated on every node, similar to blockchain, and adding transactions needs a
                            significant
                            amount of
                            processing resources. Although this increases security, it also affects efficiency, one of
                            the
                            key
                            barriers to scaling and widespread use.</p>

                        <p> Website security is vital to any website, and organisations must ensure they implement
                          appropriate levels of
                          security when designing them. All websites that will process or store European or UK
                          personal information must
                          be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ensure appropriate
                          organisational and
                          technical measures are put in place to ensure the security of this data (GDPR, 2018). This
                          report uses
                          recommended vulnerability scanning tools to assess the website for the potential
                          weaknesses

                          2014). For the scanning
                          performed on allmytype.co.uk, several tools were reviewed and selected based on criteria
                          that assessed the tools'
                          ease of use, flexibility, reputation, licensing, and ease of installation.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p> Kali Linux can be installed as a virtual machine on a device allowing users access to
                          multiple applications and
                          frameworks (Bhatt, 2018). While some of the tools offered as part of the package are more
                          complex and suited to
                          experienced penetration testers, the variety available means there is also an offering for
                          beginners with little
                          knowledge of Kali or security testing (Leroux, 2020), making the tool as straightforward
                          or
                          as complex as the
                          user requires. While downloading Kali Linux from their website is not complicated, the
                          user
                          must first have
                          some virtualisation software to install Kali on, making the process more complex. For
                          scanning allmytype.co.uk,
                          Kali Linux was chosen to gain access to a range of tools.Through Kali Linux we utilised
                          Nikto, a command-line
                          vulnerability scanner that scans for both security vulnerabilities and misconfigured web

                          We combined this with Network Mapper (Nmap) a free open-source tool (Kaur & Kaur, 2017),
                          often used for network
                          discovery and auditing by using IP packets to determine what hosts are available

                          susceptible to. Once appropriate

                        <p>Article 32 of GDPR suggests using appropriate encryption to secure any personal
                          information
                          being stored or while in transit (GDPR, 2018).
                          A Nikto scan of allmytype.co.uk revealed the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate is
                          encrypted, as shown in figure 5,
                          using AEAD Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 256bit key in Galois/Counter mode (AES
                          256 GCM) and Secure Hash Algorithm 384 (SHA384)
                          which is more secure than other algorithms like SHA-1 (TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM, 2021).
                        </p>
                        <p> AES encryption encrypts plaintext inputs and cryptographic keys and yields an encrypted
                          block of byte data that is decrypted by the receiver
                          with the same key. This AES encryption supports the block cipher mode GCM which uses a
                          cryptographic key of 128 or 256 bits in
                          length (Google Cloud, N.D).</p>
                        <p> Security Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA384) produces a hash value of 384 bits as a 96-digit
                          hexadecimal number. This helps verify if a file has been
                          altered (WEB Tools, N.D).</p>

                          Advanced Persistent Malware, SSL Stripping Attacks,
                          Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and brute force attacks and AES is known to be more resistant
                          to
                          the recent quantum attacks, which makes it a
                          preferred encryption solution (Rao et al., 2017).</p>

                          platform designed for web hosting servers. Researchers from Cisco's Talos unit discovered
                          that Imunify360 could exploit
                          a high-severity vulnerability. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a server
                          using a specially crafted file.

                        <p>The scan in figure 5 shows The X-XSS protection header is not defined. Data is sent to a
                          web user as dynamic content without
                          being validated to verify that it doesn't contain malicious software. XSS attacks occur
                          when
                          an untrusted source like a web
                          browser enters data into a web application without validation. Web browsers typically
                          receive malicious code in the form of
                          JavaScript, but it can also be HTML, Flash, or any other code the browser can execute.</p>
                        <p>Attacks using XSS are almost limitless, but they commonly involve sending private
                          information to the attacker and redirecting
                          it back to the victim. An XSS attacker may use the victim to access content controlled by
                          the attacker or perform other
                          malicious operations on the victim's machine while posing as the infected site itself.</p>

                        <p>Whilst this report identifies a number of vulnerabilities found within allmytype.co.uk,
                          the
                          organisation must be aware that
                          these may not be the only ones to exist. There were other vulnerabilities explored in the
                          design document that have not
                          been found due to the tools selected and the ability to test. These are, Software and Data
                          Integrity Failures, Weak Login
                          Credentials; Insufficient Logging & Monitoring and SQL Injection. Further investigation
                          should be done to test for these
                          potential vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p> We recommend that all of the mitigation activities mentioned throughout the report be
                          addressed to further enhance the security
                          of the site and to reduce the risk of personal information being disclosed to unauthorised
                          individuals. Failure to address
                          these vulnerabilities after being made aware of their presence could negatively affect the
                          company's position if under
                          investigation by the ICO.</p>
                        <p> Once the current risks are mitigated, we recommend the organisation stay informed of any
                          CVEs which could affect their site
                          and conduct regular penetration and vulnerability testing to check for new vulnerabilities
                          that could be introduced, followed
                          by further mitigating actions to address any findings, thus implementing a cycle of
                          regular
                          checks and fixes to maintain
                          compliance with GDPR.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, we deem the organisation to have implemented some technical measures to
                          ensure the security of the website
                          and this should be improved and then maintained.</p>

                        <p>The attention in Unit 11 was all on the Executive Summary.
                          We also had our final team meeting, during which we have finalised the submission
                          In this unit, we covered what was future internet architectures. This was reviewed
                          in various papers and the lecture cast. The individual reading tasks were then
                          followed by a debate, my team was assigned to debate a topic on the benefits
                          of the peer-to-peer network architecture.</p>
                        <p>I have enjoyed exploring these subjects, but I cannot say that I see these
                          technologies happening anytime soon.</p>
                        <p> Writing my debate argument supporting our team's position, there was a lot of information
                          on the learning platform. We had to prepare a presentation as a team outlining all our
                          arguments supporting the peer-to-peer architecture.</p>
                        <p>I have improved various skills through this teamwork experience, such as time management,
                          systematic data analysis skills compromise, and workload management. Overall, I have
                          found working with a team challenging but also rewarding.</p>

                      <p>In Unit 12, we continued debating about future internet technologies as it is the last
                        module, we also had to finalise our e-portfolios and submit a reflective piece.</p>
                      <p>This week’s reading materials focused on the information security management approach
                        (Soomro et al., 2016). It also investigated some other subjects, such as the security
                        policies applied at the national level (Azmi et al., 2016) and the decentralised public
                        critical infrastructure (Huang, 2019). Since I have been considering a career in information
                        security and policy management, this is a worthwhile read.</p>
                      <p>I liked the paper by Soomro et al. since it has once again highlighted the importance
                        of security and should not consider it something the IT department alone is responsible
                        for. Still, instead, it should play a significant role in the business management process,
                        and any security concerns should be addressed with overall organisation management on the
                        site.
                      </p>
                      <p> The paper on the security policies applied at the national level was also rather
                        interesting.
                        I don't think I ever thought about this subject very much and didn't realise that over 50
                        countries
                        worldwide have a national-level security policy developed. While some nations have implemented
                        these policies to ensure economic stability and security, there were other reasons for such
                        policies,
                        such as political or cultural values.</p>

                      <h4>Final reflection of the module</p>
                      </h4>
                      <p> Unit 1's learning outcomes were threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and basic information
                        security
                        management
                        principles; the task allowed me to put what I learned from the lecture cast into practice. In
                        addition to
                        researching ways to mitigate the medical mannequin vulnerabilities, I also enjoyed studying
                        the
                        mitigation
                        strategies presented in the paper. The 'Network and information security management' module
                        focuses on
                        teamwork; I was included in group two with the assigned website allmytype. Co. UK</p>
                      <p> Seminar one, in-unit 2, was on the vulnerabilities of the medical mannequin as reviewed by
                        Glisson et al. (2015).
                        STRIDE threat modeling and DREAD risk analysis industrial standard toolkit to classify threats
                        and
                        demonstrate
                        the risk analysis objectives without overcomplicating them.</p>
                      <p> In Unit 3, the scanning exercise of Group 2's website (allmytype.co.uk) and discussing the
                        findings. We also had to
                        submit our final post on medical mannequin vulnerabilities and prepare for next week's seminar
                        on
                        TCP/IP and ISO/OSI 7-layer
                        internet protocols. The article on medical mannequins (Glisson, 2015) has given me a clear
                        idea of
                        the vulnerability of IoT
                        devices and how to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Peer contributions helped to clarify some
                        points that I had initially
                        misunderstood. Throughout our tasks this week, we achieved our unit learning goals of
                        expressing
                        basic network concepts,
                        performing basic network troubleshooting, and enumerating the differences between IPV4 and
                        IPV6
                        standards.</p>
                      <p> During Unit 4, we were to scan the website "allmytype, co.UK." We discussed our scan results
                        and
                        summarised them within
                        either an initial post or a team post on the initial discussion forum. During the discussion.
                      </p>
                      <p>The seminar discussion on the TCP/IP and the ISO/OSI protocols helped clarify the importance
                        of
                        both models, as
                        TCP/IP is better for the functional approach. In contrast, ISO/OSI is appropriate for
                        documentation, among others.</p>
                      <p>For Unit 5, While preparing for the seminar in Unit 6, I gained an ample amount of knowledge
                        on
                        penetration testing
                        tools. Reviewed the functions of various network components, such as switches, routers,
                        firewalls,
                        and gateways.
                        This week, we published our summary post on the basic scans utilising advanced network
                        diagnostic
                        tools such as
                        scanners and packet sniffers performed in Unit 3. We submitted the design document and the
                        individual peer reviews.</p>
                      <p> Group 2 Initial post on evaluating network scanning and intrusion tools and justifying the
                        selection criteria for the
                        selected tools. As a result, my knowledge of vulnerability scanning has improved, using
                        valuable
                        criteria learnt in applying
                        the appropriate tool for critical vulnerability and penetration scanning situations. As my
                        knowledge of theoretical
                        vulnerability assessments, such as STRIDE and DREAD, grows, I feel more capable and confident
                        in
                        applying them to given case studies.</p>
                      <p>In unit 7, we conducted an e-portfolio activity learning about conducting vulnerability scans
                        using Kali; I enjoyed the scans
                        themselves and learned the disadvantages of using this tool as against other tools like Nessus
                        and
                        the enormous advantages
                        the Kali tool has, like its availability as a 'live distro' no requirement to install it. The
                        article illustrates the need for
                        a good specialist to consider the technical aspects, such as running scanners and penetration
                        testing tools, patching the
                        systems, and contributing to business continuity and data recovery policies.</p>
                      <p> Unit 8 was all about GDPR, case studies, and the analysis of these case studies. GDPR as it
                        applies to our assigned website.
                        We also looked at other standards as they apply to my assigned website, allmytype.co.uk. The
                        teamwork was very fruitful
                        as the mitigative measures to help our assigned website meet the standards applicable to its
                        specific industry, such as
                        data and privacy (GDPR) or financial (PCI-DSS). The proposals made by our team were very
                        comprehensive. These case studies
                        assume that the companies believe that they have everything in place to meet GDPR
                        requirements.
                        Still, when the investigation
                        got underway, it became apparent that their interpretations of the requirements were not
                        entirely
                        accurate. The GDPR leaves
                        room for interpretation, so this is the primary concern for most businesses.
                        Companies should consider reviewing case studies annually to ensure their policies stand firm
                        if
                        investigated.</p>
                      <p> I have enjoyed unit 9 because it taught me about SIEM tools, various security threats,
                        digital
                        forensics, logs, and logging tools.
                        In this unit, we learned about the multiple types of logs found on the Linux and Windows
                        systems
                        and the tools used to read, synthesise, and analyse
                        logs. However, I know that there will not be any fruitful incident investigations without
                        logging.
                        Forensic technics were also valuable knowledge
                        gained in this unit.</p>
                      <p> The topic covered in unit 10 (types of breaches) has been studied briefly previously, so it
                        was
                        good to review it again. This
                        course has helped me better understand the various kinds of security breaches.</p>
                      <p> The Executive Summary was the principal project in Unit 11. We covered future internet
                        architectures such as SDN and FIAs, their
                        impact, and challenges with current and innovative solutions, reviewed in various papers and
                        the
                        lecture cast. A debate followed the
                        individual reading tasks; my team topic was “We believe that the future of the Internet is
                        based
                        on peer-to-peer overlay-based
                        networking (BitTorrent, TOR, Freenet, KAD).” I have improved various skills through this
                        debate,
                        learning and researching the future
                        of the internet. Working as a team is demanding and rewarding as experiences like working as a
                        team and managing time have been highly valued.</p>
                      <p>This week’s readings (unit 12) focus on the information security management approach, such as
                        the
                        national security policies and the
                        decentralised public critical infrastructure. It improved my knowledge of the potential future
                        of
                        internet architecture and the essential
                        role of information security management in modern computing solutions.</p>
                      <p> After completing this module, I can identify and analyse security risks and vulnerabilities
                        in
                        IT network systems and select
                        acceptable processes, tools, and techniques for managing and resolving them. Create solutions
                        that
                        help manage and audit risk
                        and security issues by designing and critically evaluating computer programmes and tactics.
                      </p>
                      <p> To aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues, gather and synthesise
                        information from various sources
                        (including internet security alerts and warning sites). Describe the legal, social, ethical,
                        and
                        professional concerns that
                        information security experts face.</p>
