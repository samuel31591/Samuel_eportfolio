                      </p>
                      <p>Compromising a Medical Mannequin.

                        It has been observed that the pace of technological advancement in the medical industry is faster than the pace of cyber security considerations (Glisson et al., 2015). The critical observation is that a breach of a training tool would result
                         in a clinician receiving incorrect guidance when problem-solving is insightful. A discrepancy between technology and security considerations in this industry can potentially result in a fatality. 
                        
                        The studies were conducted on a mannequin model (istan), a wireless patient simulator used at the university's College of Nursing. The device can bleed, secrete bodily fluids, has blood pressure and heart rate, and breathes realistically. 
                        The simulator links with iStan software, which controls the mannequin remotely (Still, 2015). By identifying the network security solution and network protocol as the vulnerable components,
                         brute-force attacks against the router PIN, as well as denial-of-service attacks using open-source tools such as Backtrack
                        
                        The tools implemented in this experiment were not sophisticated or difficult to acquire. However, this alone highlights the lack of security currently being implemented in these devices.
                        
                        A brute force attack that targeted the Wi-Fi and a denial-of-service attack rendering the unit inoperable were used to demonstrate the vulnerability of the medical
                        mannequin. A Denial of service (DOS) attack is designed to shut down or make the target unusable. This is accomplished by flooding the target with a large amount of data that the device cannot handle, causing it to become unresponsive.
                        
                         There are several ways to mitigate brute force attacks, such as changing passwords frequently, increasing password length, limiting login attempts, and
                        implementing multifactor authentication. A proactive approach would be setting up alerts for brute force attacks and monitoring and stopping them before they
                        are fully deployed (Varonis, 2021).
                        
                        DOS attacks can be prevented by proactively monitoring a system for any unusual activity by creating a baseline. 
                        In addition to this monitoring, an effective method could also be to implement a VPN with MFA required to access the medical device (Phoenixnapp,2018).
                         Over the years, medical devices have gone from being utterly non-connected to being both wirelessly and software controlled.
                         It's worth bearing in mind that there is an international standard to which medical devices must certify; The IEC 62304 Medical device software,
                          which was put in place to prevent cyber-criminal events on medical devices. However,
                          the standard has not been updated to consider and include either network connectivity or cybersecurity (Williams, Woolward, 2015). When medical device manufacturers are required by law to implement strict security measures into the lifecycle of their products,
                           we will likely see the threats above, and vulnerabilities decrease.

                      <p>
                      <h6> Hi Isioma</h6>
                      </p>
                      <p>As rightly pointed out Isioma, medical systems are also considered IoT systems. IoT, while influential and beneficial, introduces several security issues. IoT's key risks include network vulnerabilities and outdated software and firmware (Shea, 2021).
                         they often are produced with Weak or hardcoded passwords. By default, attackers may already know the device's password. Usually, passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot be changed,
                          and are vulnerable to credential theft. One notable example of such an attack is Mirai malware. The Lack of an update process or mechanism.

                        Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and connectivity. Unfortunately, when hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or 
                        bugs, they become vulnerable even if they are secure at purchase. Over time, IoT devices become exposed if regular updates are not applied (Thales, 2021).
                        
                        In addition to the mitigative measures, you have already stated in this discussion. To mitigate the risks associated with this device, manufacturers of the mannequin should 
                        consider policies such as password complexity, password expiration, account lockout, and one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when setting up the device.
                        
                        Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the likelihood of IoT attacks. Only signed updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for authenticity
                         when applying updates (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).

                      <h6>Hi Abidemi,</h6>
                      </p>
                      <p>By disabling WPS, the mannequin can't easily connect to the network, making it more vulnerable. 

                        The WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a wireless network security standard that makes connections between a router and wireless devices (mannequins) faster and easier.
                         Wireless Protected Setup is a key exchange mechanism rather than a security mechanism. It facilitates connections between devices and access points and is one of
                          the vulnerable points of a network. 
                        
                        WPS works with WPA/WPA2/PSK and allows devices to establish connections to WLANs. Utilizing the  following methods  
                        
                        PIN: Entering a PIN on the device
                        
                        Push-button: A physical or virtual push-button should be pressed on both the access point and the client device during the connection phase.
                        
                        NFC: To use Near Field Communication, the client must bring their device close to the access point.
                        
                        USB drive:  Necessary connection information exchange between an access point and a device is done using a USB drive.
                        
                        The short length of WPS PINs and the fact that both PIN parts are validated separately means that an online brute force attack on the PIN can be made within several hours, allowing an attacker to access a WLAN (mannequin device).
                        
                        Wireless LAN clients can authenticate their users and ensure user confidentiality through WPA or WPA2.
                        
                        WPA is vulnerable to the offline dictionary attack since the information required to create and verify a session key is broadcasted (Noureddine
                        
                        Boudriga, 2019, p.270) Using WPA2/enterprise security and mutual client and server authentication provides the most secure and protected wireless network 
                        compared to the WPA and WEP.

                      <p><b>Unit reflection</b></p>

                      <p>During unit 1 we had collaborative discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable to medical mannequin mitigation.
                         Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats risks and vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                          helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed researching the ways to mitigate the
                         threats discusses in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities and I think the task has allowed me to improve my research
                         and information synthesis skills also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                         The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork, which I personally found quite interesting 
                         and challenging at the same time since our team is made of four and we all reside in different parts of the world with different time zone
                         and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I do believe it will be more challenging than 
                         teamwork however, it has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork skills, but also time management, planning,
                         online meeting etiquette, etc.
                         One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the team worked well together and were able to
                         complete the contract efficiently.

                          </p>
                          <p>In the initial post, Tolofari, S. (2021) related how cyberattacks could significantly
                            affect society causing chaos and substantial financial and reputational loss to companies. A
                            breach probably affects a company's infrastructure, like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware
                            attack that affected energy availability and compromised the personal information of nearly
                            6,000 individuals, creating disorder, confusion, and property loss(Business, 2021).
                            According to Danialou, M.(2021), on the peer response, we are already amid a "cyber
                            pandemic" with the number of attacks on critical infrastructures rising sharply.
                            It was also Highlighted that inadequate cyber security has led to substantial economic loss
                            to companies through litigation and fines over data breaches and violations. For example,
                            laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Intersoft Consulting, 2018) fined
                            British Airways through the UK's data protection authority after customer data leakage due
                            to poor data security. Equifax incurred almost 148 million due to compromised data records
                            (Johnson, 2021). DigiNotar, a certificate authority, went bankrupt due to the control of all
                            eight of the company's certificate-issuing servers pinpointing the unwavering need for cyber
                            security (Fisher, D 2012).
                            The effect of cybercrime on healthcare industries in the initial post, Okafor-Tolofari, I.
                            (2021), was extensively discussed. An example was the WannaCry Ransomware that cost the NHS
                            £92 million in recovery. The evolution of medicine significantly depends on IoT devices to
                            provide critical medical services. A cyber-attack that affects these facilities will result
                            in the loss of life and jeopardy in society.
                            The covid pandemic that hit the world, as agreed with Jurbe. in the peer response, has
                            changed the way we work, with remote work and studies being the solution and an alternative
                            to the pandemic (Jubet, 2021). Imagine a disruption of cyber activities, what catastrophe
                            and chaos it will cause the world's economy, and its imbalance to society.
                            The need for having well-trained and staffed cybersecurity professionals in business,
                            government agencies cannot be overemphasised. A lack of it will significantly affect the
                            business economically, cause reputational loss, and create a volatile society.</p></br>

                            <p> Security is a crucial part of any application or environment (Bullock and Benford,

                              and
                              granting access to these secured applications and the environment needs to be
                              controlled;
                              who
                              gets access to what? What are the rules? How is it tracked? These are managed through an
                              access control system providing access to restricted areas of the business (SailPoint,
                              2021).”
                              Access control is governed according to the space within which subjects and objects
                              reside,
                              and the ability to traverse space to get close to an object” by Bullock and Benford,

                            <p>Hardware embedded chips are evolving technologies that authenticate users using

                            <p>Authentication and authorisation are vital in access control management, verifying a

                              depending on the given authority level; these ensure that security is maintained both in
                              the

                          <p>Samuel, thanks for this interesting post on authentication and authorisation.

                            To add some insight.

                            Authentication and authorisation are multi-deployment security system that plays an
                            essential
                            role in securing systems, confirming identities and granting access. authentication and
                            authorisation are two of the most critical aspects of system control because providing a
                            secure
                            environment on the internet is a daunting task. (Saracino and Mori, 2020)

                            Authenticating the identity of users before authoring access to any data or applications
                            is
                            critical, which makes authorisation the second step after authentication. Supporting the
                            view
                            that authentication and authorisation can either permit or deny access to a system are
                            based
                            on
                            various criteria. In basic security service, and identity authentication is the first and
                            the
                            most crucial defence line for vital information and network security mechanisms in every
                            society. (Wang et al., 2013).
                            however, when applied together, proof to be a powerful tool to successfully manage and
                            prevent
                            access to sensitive data in a cyber environment.

                            Most of the security operating systems in use today use Authentication and authorisation,
                            which
                            is explained based on the privileges of the user. An example is the Discretionary access
                            control
                            system, which has the principle of access restriction, i.e. where the owner of the system
                            determines who get access to the security system. (Lopez, Oppliger and Pernul, 2004)


                            Mandatory Access Control is among the most critical of secure access systems, allowing
                            access
                            based on clearance level, where users cannot make any change to the access rights. (Hu,
                            Kuhn
                            and
                            Yaga, 2017)</p>
                          Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts network access by implementing the principle of
                          least
                          privilege. Only those permissions should be implied by roles required to carry out the
                          responsibilities of a job that performs an organisational function. (Lopez, Oppliger and
                          Pernul,
                          2004)</p>

                          <h4><b>Post by Richard Meadows;Peer Response</b></h4>
                          </p>
                          <p> Hi, I agree with your post. Firstly, the importance of authentication and authorisation
                            is
                            well documented. In 2020, the most common password was still 123456 (Fruhlinger & Martin,
                            2021;
                            Whitney, 2020) which shows that the message still is not getting through. Users are not
                            protecting themselves adequately, and systems do not provide sufficient rules for creating
                            secure passwords.
                            But is the onus on the system owners or the users themselves to ensure appropriate
                            standards
                            when authenticating? In many cases, the organisation will be required to put specific
                            standards
                            in place, however I believe that education for users, or at least uptake, is still also
                            lacking
                            and therefore more still needs to be done.

                            As you have alluded, a single mode of authentication may not be enough, and multifactor
                            authentication (using various types) in particular is a very good method of protecting
                            user
                            identity. In a digital world where almost anything can be spoofed, having multiple forms
                            of
                            authentication makes it exponentially more difficult to fake an identity, both when
                            carrying
                            out
                            transactions and authenticating to systems.
                            Artificial intelligence may well be the way forward, together with attribute-based
                            authentication which takes many factors into account during the authentication process.

                            In terms of authorisation, following the principle of least privilege, whereby a subject
                            is
                            only
                            given the minimum permissions or privileges to do any specific task, can protect against
                            malicious or accidental misuse, and help to limit the effects of advanced persistent
                            threats
                            (APT).

                          <p>I agree with your post, Samuel. As Richard pointed out, the most common password is still
                            123456. It is clear that passwords create risk and in order for enterprises to truly
                            protect
                            their systems, apps, and data, all requests for access to corporate resources must include
                            more
                            than just a user name and password. A key tenet of the Zero Trust model is strong access
                            management. Businesses may increase security and improve the user experience by switching
                            to
                            a
                            modern Identity and Access Management solution that includes capabilities like
                            passwordless
                            authentication and adaptive MFA. Secure access in Zero Trust Model would look like this:
                            Do I know the user?
                            Have I seen this device before?
                            Does the device meet our standards?
                            What is our risk tolerance?
                            Should we grant or deny access?
                            Adaptive MFA provides contextual information and can determine which authentication
                            factors
                            apply to a particular situation. Users may be required to only accept a push notification
                            if
                            the
                            situation is deemed less risky, or maybe enter an SMS code also if the situation is deemed
                            medium risky and altogether denied if the situation is deemed high risk.</p>

                          <p>Hi Samuel, this is an important security feature. Authentication and Authorization
                            require
                            Identification features. Passwords are a means of Identification provided mostly at the
                            application layer. Initially, password Identification would require a 4-digit numeric
                            number
                            but
                            nowadays, these are considered weak. Applications like the Google password Manager can
                            generate
                            strong passwords with a combination of numeric, alphanumeric and special characters.

                            There are also advance identification methods like biometric identification which employs
                            user's
                            physical attributes like fingerprint, iris, retina, faces and voice. Advancements now
                            incorporate multibiometric schemes for user authentication (Luis-Garcia et al., 2003).

                            Authentication and Authorization will keep advancing depending on how the identification
                            features evolve. As you mentioned, identifying who someone is, has long passed username
                            and
                            passwords to more advanced Artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies. There
                            is
                            also
                            the multi-factor authentication, that is, verifying an individual identity based on two to
                            three
                            different parameters, something you have, know and are. This can therefore be inferred
                            that
                            the
                            potential in this security feature, will not be exhausted anytime soon as long as there
                            are
                            unique and differing attributes in life. In my opinion, the challenge may only lie on the
                            ability to integrate new identification features into Authorization and Authentication.

                            <p>The importance of control mechanisms (how, who, and to what extent) access is granted
                              into
                              a
                              network cannot be overemphasised, authenticating a user into the network, as discussed
                              during
                              this period. One of the weakest links in security is the user; as pointed out by Richard
                              (Tolofari and Meadows, 2021), users need to be educated on how to create their
                              passwords,
                              not
                              using conventional passwords like 12345. The Open Web Application Security Project
                              (OWASP),
                              among other bodies, provides guidance on minimum criteria for a strong password, that
                              passwords
                              cannot be shorter than eight and should be enforced by applications (NIST SP800-63B).
                              Maximum
                              password length should not be set too low and more; ensure credentials change when there
                              is
                              compromise or password leak.

                              A password alone cannot guarantee the security of a network; the combination of other
                              factors-
                              multifactor authentication mechanisms should be implemented." The potential in
                              multifactor
                              authentication security features will not be exhausted anytime soon as long as there are
                              unique
                              and differing attributes in life. The challenge may only lie in the ability to integrate
                              new
                              identification features into authorisation and authentication" by Jubet., Authentication
                              methods
                              are based on only the possession of credentials issued to the user. The verification is
                              performed on credentials offered at present, not considering how or when the user
                              obtained
                              the
                              credentials (Hasan and Khan, 2015).

                              Nitin also pointed out during the discussions the importance of Adaptive Multifactor
                              Authentication. Where contexts like location awareness, device fingerprinting or
                              impossible
                              velocity are added to the multifactor authentication (Stjernlof and Vries, 2020), these
                              adaptive
                              multifactor authentications using artificial intelligence is a step further to harden
                              the
                              authentication system.

                              Isioma, during the discussions, highlighted that authenticating a user before
                              authorisation;
                              granting access to data or resources in the network is crucial, not the other way round.
                              To
                              what
                              criteria and rules are the users assessed (Tolofari and Okafor -Tolofari, 2020), like

                              Discretionary access control: where the owner of the system determines who gets access
                              to

                              Authentication and authorisation are essential to network security, how they are
                              implemented,
                              and to what extent should depend on the asset's value. The efficiency depends on the
                              technology
                              used to enforce this authentication and authorisation process.</p>

                              <p>Web-based appointment and scheduling is a computerised system that
                                enables patients (users) to access information and perform routine tasks independently
                                through the internet.
                                The web-based appointment and scheduling management information system was
                                created and installed in 2011 (Maeder, Martin-Sanchez, and Firm, 2012) and was
                                put to study to determine its usefulness compared to the traditional appointment
                                method (physical) and the phone appointment system, which has difficulty dealing
                                with the high volume of calls as in the case of Queens medical centre, a community
                                clinic. When measured against benefit and ease of use, the result shows that
                                patients choose to use an online appointment system because they provide an easy
                                and effective way to make an appointment with reduced waiting time than the phone
                                call method (Maeder, Martin-Sanchez and Firm, 2012).

                                security and protection of the information collected should be paramount.
                                The Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), which governs and
                                oversees the health sector, regulate how information is acquired and used

                                their health information is used are similarly protected under the Privacy Rule.
                                The Privacy Rule's primary purpose is to ensure that people's health data is
                                protected while maintaining the flow of health information necessary to provide
                                and promote high-quality health care and protect the public's health and wellbeing.

                                (ATTACK TREE) represents an attack on the web application scheduling system

                                interdependencies between attacks. In a tree representation, the attacker's goal is
                                the root (the network), and the nodes are meant to help him achieve this goal.

                                is asked to provide account details. These credentials are then harvested by the threat
                                actor and used for malicious purposes like compromising the web appointment scheduling
                                application (Lininger and Vines, 2005).</p>

                          <p>The Queen's Medical Centre receptionist spends most of their time answering
                            phones, explaining options to patients, and managing schedules, all of which can be
                            automated. In the same way, the patient enjoys the time-saving advantages.
                            Patients who wish to make an appointment with the centre do not need to take time
                            out of their busy schedules to call. Patients will be able to access services faster
                            if
                            they use the web-based appointment scheduling information management system,
                            which is also a great way to provide same-day or next-day medical services if
                            desired and if a doctor's schedule allows it, patients can easily schedule
                            last-minute
                            appointments (Collective, 2019). The web-based application and scheduling
                            information management system also perform vital functions as;

                          <p> Thank you for submitting your Programming assignment for the Launching into Cyber
                            Security
                            Module

                            In this assignment, you were asked to produce a Python code of an implementation of a
                            security
                            solution to mitigate an identified threat, which was discussed as part of your report
                            to
                            management of Queens Medical Centre on a web-based appointment and scheduling
                            management
                            information system (ASMIS).</p>

                          <p>The learning outcome was to be able to evaluate critically the solutions developed to
                            solve/mitigate security issues and the deliverables for this assignment were:</p>
                          <p>

                          <p>The code attempts to implement a solution to Address Resolution Protocol. The
                            solution is
                            implemented using Python with Scapy package.</p>

                          <h4><b>Application of knowledge and understanding</b></h4></b>

                          <p>While the implementation appears to be sound, there is lack of clarity around the
                            actual
                            usage or application of the solution. The solution appears to be incomplete and there
                            is
                            lack
                            of testing to demonstrate expected functionality and security. For example, you could
                            show
                            how
                            successful retrieval of MAC address and other details to demonstrate expected security
                            and
                            otherwise.</p>

                          <p>
                          <h4><b>Structure and presentation (as detailed in the assessment guidance)</b></h4></b>

                          <p>There is some documentation in lines of code. The README file could be improved. Your
                            README
                            file could also indicate any dependencies. No testing of code carried out.</p>

#As reflected in the essay, man in the middle attack like the Address Resolution #Protocol

#ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning, is a network attack in which a #malicious user
sends a
forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) message over a #local area network. This causes
the
attacker's Media Access Control (MAC) #address to be linked to the IP address of a
legitimate
computer or server on the #network.
#We'll use passive monitoring or scanning to sniff packets on the Queen's medical #server
to
detect when ARP is been spoofed. When an ARP packet is received, two #things must be
checked;
if
they do not match, the server is vulnerable to an ARP #spoofing attack. We use Scapy in
Python
to
execute ARP packet detection with the #use of MAC addresses and interfaces to identify the
spoofed
ARP packets inside #the network. The two thongs are
#Source Media Access Control Address (src MAC) and The actual Media Access #Control
address of
the
sender.
#Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks. It can forge or decode
#packets,
send
them over a network, capture them, match requests, and reply to #them. It can also handle
tasks
such as scanning, traceroute, probing, unit testing, #attacks, and network discovery.

#To install Scapy, you must have Python 2.7 or Python 3.9+ installed. To prevent

As reflected in the essay, man in the middle attack like the Address Resolution

ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning, is a network attack in which a malicious user
sends a
forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) message over a local area network. This causes
the
attacker’s Media Access Control (MAC) address to be linked to the IP address of a
legitimate
computer or server on the network (Dacier et al., 2017).
In cybersecurity, there is two mitigation strategy, passive and active mitigation (Daimi
and
Peoples, 2021).
ARP monitoring is a passive mitigation strategy, monitoring or scanning to sniff packets
on
the
Queen’s medical server to detect when ARP is spoofed. When an ARP packet is received,
two
things
must be checked; if they do not match, the server is vulnerable to an ARP spoofing
attack.
We
use Scapy in Python to execute ARP packet detection using MAC addresses and interfaces
to
identify the spoofed ARP packets inside the network. The two things are
Source Media Access Control Address (src MAC) and the sender’s actual Media Access
Control
address.
Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks. It can forge or decode
packets,
send
them over a network, capture them, match requests, and reply to them. It can also handle
scanning, traceroute, probing, unit testing, attacks, and network discovery.

Machine interface is "eth0", sniffing the interface
sniff(“eth0”)

After sniffing the eth0 interface, the contents of the interface will be displayed. Here
we
see
that the interface is Ethernet, and its relevant contents are IP destination (dst),
interface
type (ARP), source (src)
We create a functional mac, given the IP address, use the Arp function to issue/create
an
ARP
request Arp request and retrieve the actual mac address instead of the IP address. The
broadcast
media access control address is set to “ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff” using the Ethernet function.
The
srp
function returns a list of two IP addresses for the response packet. The media access
control
address with the requested matching IP address will be stored in the hwsrc field.
A function will be created to get the media access control address and process the
sniffed
packet, bringing the value of the old media access control in the variable and the value
of
the
media access control in the response as the variable response mac. Scapy operates by
encoding
the ARP packet type in the field "op", the default op is 1 or "who has", which is an ARP
request.

def mac(ipadd):

If it’s wrong then will throw error
arp_request = scapy.ARP(pdst=ipadd)
br = scapy.Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
arp_req_br = br / arp_request
list_1 = scapy.srp(arp_req_br, timeout=5,

originalmac = mac(packet[scapy.ARP].psrc)
# responsemac will get response of the MAC
responsemac = packet[scapy.ARP].hwsrc
Now, we compare these two values and check if they are similar. If they are not similar,
the
values are being spoofed. The values compared are the real Media Access Control address
and
the
response Media Access Control Address.

Comparing values of real MAC Address and response MAC Address

# store=False tells sniff () function
# To discard sniffed packets
scapy.sniff(iface=interface, store=False,
prn=process_sniffed_packet)

Defining function to process sniffed packet
def process_sniffed_packet(packet):

If it is an ARP packet and if it is an ARP Response
if packet.haslayer(scapy.ARP) and packet[scapy.ARP].op == 2:

# originalmac will get old MAC whereas
originalmac = mac(packet[scapy.ARP].psrc)
# responsemac will get response of the MAC
responsemac = packet[scapy.ARP].hwsrc
Machine interface is "eth0", sniffing the interface
sniff(“eth0”)

With the script all done, all that is left to do is to get the arguments and call the
sniff
function to test it.
Additionally, the sore=False tells the sniff
function to discard the packets instead of storing them in the memory; this can be very
important specifically when the scripts run for a long time.
In this case when we run the script, there is nothing that will happen obviously and
this is
because, there is no spoofing that is currently happening.
However, in case an attacker tries to spoof the ARP, when this script is active then
there
will
be a response telling
the IT team that there is an attack in progress,
plus both the true and fake MAC addresses. For the case of Queens medical center, they
are
susceptible to several attack such as man in the middle attacks,
denial of service, and even session hijacking and all these can be preventing by having
the
script to detect the ARP spoofing (Xia, Hu, and Xu, 2019).
