                        <p>In the first week of the information risk management module, we met our tutor,
                           talked about the upcoming assignments, and began learning about some of the 
                           fundamentals of risk management in terms of information security.			
                          The reading for this unit included the first three chapters of the Sutton
                           book on information risk management from 2021, the Hubbard book on risk management 
                           failure from 2009, and the NIST risk management guide from 2002. The book by
                            Hubbard is quite divisive. I don't think it's a bad idea for management teams 
                            at different companies to use the non-quantitative risk assessment approach. 
                            Insurance and finance companies, for example, frequently have a large amount 
                            of pre-existing data that can be used to calculate risk likelihood, impact,
                             cost, and so on. Small and medium-sized businesses, on the other hand, do not
                              have access to this information. Risk management must still be performed based 
                              on the best assumptions, which is why I believe those with low, medium, and high 
                              qualifications are valuable.		
                          The NIST publication was also very informative. This document provided very clear and 
                          informative risk management guidance that less experienced professionals implementing
                           risk management systems could easily follow. Hopefully, we can put this information 
                           to use during our team assignments.</p>

                        <p> The assignment is at its early stage. We all agreed to do an individual

                          restructure the tables we had in the document in order to meet the 
                          requirements.

                              <h3>MY INITIAL POST</h3>
                              </p>
                              <p>The article's authors discussed whether user participation is necessary for security
                                 risk management (SRM) using a qualitative and quantitative approach. The qualitative 
                                 approach gathered information on the activities, behaviours, and assignments defining
                                  user participation. They then used quantitative methods to assess the model.</p>

                                <p>User participation in SRM was found to raise organisational consciousness of security
                                 risks and controls within targeted business processes and eased the greater alignment
                                  of SRM with business objectives, values, and needs. User participation creates awareness
                                   of security risks and controls within targeted business processes. As a result, the
                                    development and performance of security controls will improve (Spears and Barki, 2010).</p>
                                
                                  <p>IS security literature has often cited users as the weak link in IS security due to user 
                                errors and negligence. The present study provides empirical evidence that suggests otherwise.
                                 User participation raises organisational awareness of security risks and controls within 
                                 business processes. The need for regulatory compliance may encourage user participation 
                                 in SRM. Security managers can use regulatory compliance to engage users, raise 
                                 organisational awareness of security, and better align security measures with business 
                                 objectives.</p>

                                To compensate for this lack of access, we will rely on case studies and other academic
                                 sources to gather information as qualitative measures and then use the quantitative 
                                 measures to analyse the collected data.</p>

                      <p>In unit 2, we have been asked to submit an initial collaborative discussion forum post and
                         to read up on the risk identification processes. We have started work on the unit 3 team assignment
                          document. </p>
		
                        <p> The collaborative discussion required us to read a paper on the user participation impact on
                         the Information Systems Security Risk Management (Spears & Barki, 2010) and to 	answer some
                          questions, such as providing details of the quantitative vs. qualitative research methods
                           used by the authors, their discoveries on how the users have a positive impact 	on the 
                           risk management processes, etc. Also, how do we think not having any users to work with
                            will impact our risk assessments we will have to complete?  </p>		
                          <p> I found the article interesting. Although the users provide very useful information required
                         to design good quality information security risk management policies and that the user
                          involvement may increase their awareness and willingness to follow these policies, in my
                           opinion, humans remain the weakest link in cybersecurity. </p> 		
                          <p>  Human errors are common in every industry. Stress at work, a lack of sleep, etc. can lead us
                         to make wrong decisions that in turn inadvertently breach security. It reduces the risk of
                          human-related vulnerabilities, but it does not remove them. </p>
                            
                        <p>  We also had to read a chapter in the book by Sutton (2021) on the risk identification process.
                         The author provided some very helpful tips on how to assess the identified risk impact, who 
                         should be involved in these assessments, as well as some helpful tips on how the semi-quantitative
                          impact assessment methods could be used.  </p>		
                        <p> The auhor has also highlighted that when assessing the impact, employee wellbeing impact should
                         also be considered, which, I have to say, I did not think about it. In my opinion, employee
                          wellbeing is a very important aspect of the risk assessment, and based on my not having thought
                           about it before, it made me wonder how many more professionals in the IT industry would only 
                           assess the impact by considering only the technical, operational, and user-related risk aspects. </p>
                            
                          <p> During the week, we also started working on our Unit 3 assignment and submitted our team contract.
                         It was a little harder to get started on this module since we were not allocated to our teams until 
                         the start of 2. However, everyone in our team had worked together before, and so getting into the 
                         rhythm wasn't too difficult. complicated. We made good progress on our assignment, which is coming 
                         up in the unit, and had a team meeting on Sunday to agree on what is left to complete on the assignment.

                                    </p>
    
                                  <p>thank you for your initial discussion post. You have nicely summarised the paper by Spears and Barki (2010).
                                     However, I disagree with the statement that the authors have provided evidence proving the users are not the
                                      greatest information security risk. I agree with the paper: users can provide many benefits to the Security 
                                      Risk Management strategy and participation can reduce the Information security risks by improving the 
                                      user's buy-in into the security. However, I do not think that the users being the greatest risk and an 
                                      advantage are mutually exclusive: the user involvement can provide many benefits whilst the users will 
                                      continue being the greatest security risk. </p>

                                    <p> A report published by Tessian (2022) looked into why the human errors causing the data breaches happen in
                                     the first place and the reasons such as distractions and burnout were identified. The same company did a
                                      report in 2020 (Tessian) and the percentage of people who identified distractions as the main reason has 
                                      increased in 2022 report due to moving to the remote working settings. These reasons why the data breaches 
                                      happen is not something that can be eradicated by involving people in the Security Risk Management processes,
                                       in my opinion . </p>
                                    
                                      <p> Do you have any thoughts on this? </p>

                                    I cannot agree more that Humans are the weakest link in the security chain. 52% of businesses
                                    admit that employees are their biggest weakness in IT security, with their careless actions
                                    putting business IT security strategies at risk. More than 90% of cybersecurity issues 
                                    originate from human error within your organisation, not externally (Saylor Academy, 2021).  </p>

                                    management and its influence in the context of regulatory compliance via a multi-method study 
                                    at the organisational level. Eleven informants across five organisations were interviewed to 
                                    understand the types of activities and security controls in which users participated as part 
                                    of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance on which research model was developed based on the qualitative 
                                    study findings and extant user participation theories in the systems development literature. 
                                    The research model supported the analysis of the data collected in a questionnaire survey of
                                    ISACA, a professional association specialising in information technology governance, audit, and
                                    security. Findings indicated that user participation contributed to improved security control 
                                    performance (Spears and Barki, 2010)  </p>
                                    
                                  <p> Risk assessment personnel can use a questionnaire to collect relevant information about the management
                                    and operational controls planned for the IT system. The questionnaire could also be used during on-site
                                    visits and interviews. Interviews with IT system support and management personnel can enable risk 
                                    assessment personnel to collect useful information (Stoneburner, Goguen and Feringa, 2002)

                                  <p>Regarding the two methods complementing each other, In quantitative analysis,
                                    risks are sorted by their financial impact, assets by their financial value, 
                                    and the result is expressed in a specific management terminology. The 
                                    evaluation and results are based on objective methods. In contrast, the 
                                    qualitative approach makes it easier to understand and observe the level 
                                    of risk, with the methods of calculation being simple and easy to implement.
                                    The frequency of occurrence of threats does not need to be quantified as the 
                                    monetary value of information is not determined, which makes the analysis 
                                    easier. Therefore quantitative calculations of frequency and impact are not 
                                    necessary.</p>
                                    
                                  <p> They both have their drawbacks. In the quantitative approach, the value of the 
                                    risk impact is based on the subjective opinion of the people involved. The 
                                    process takes a long time, and the results are presented only in monetary value
                                    and are hard to understand by people without experience. The process is complex.
                                    Unlike the qualitative approach, a cost-benefit analysis is not implemented, only 
                                    a subjective approach of the author, which makes it challenging to implement 
                                    controls. There is insufficient differentiation between major risks, and the 
                                    result depends on the quality of the management team.</p>

                                  Concerning two techniques supplementing one another, In quantitative examination, 
                                  chances are arranged by their monetary effect, resources by their monetary worth, 
                                  and the outcome is communicated in a particular administration phrasing. The 
                                  assessment and results depend on true strategies. Conversely, the subjective 
                                  methodology makes it more clear and notice the degree of hazard, with the strategies 
                                  for computation being basic and simple to carry out. The recurrence of event of
                                  dangers needn't bother with to be evaluated as the financial worth of still up in 
                                  the air, which makes the examination simpler. In this manner quantitative computations
                                  of recurrence and effect are excessive. The two of them have their disadvantages.
                                  In the quantitative methodology, the worth of the gamble influence depends on the 
                                  abstract assessment of individuals included. The cycle consumes a large chunk of the
                                  day, and the outcomes are introduced exclusively in financial worth and are difficult
                                  to comprehend by individuals without experience. The cycle is intricate. Not at all 
                                  like the subjective methodology, a money saving advantage examination isn't carried 
                                  out, just an emotional methodology of the creator, which makes it trying to execute 
                                  controls. There is inadequate separation between significant dangers, and the outcome
                                  relies upon the nature of the supervisory group. </p>

                                              <p>This report evaluates the three ERP solutions; commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), open-source,
                                              and in-house, based on key elements in the framework, including the involvement of 
                                              organisational levels, critical success factors, implementation methodology and process,
                                              and relevant risks. COTS solutions are considered to be more suitable for SMEs and easier 
                                              to manage, as well as projects to replace the company's deprecated systems, making them more
                                              efficient, and keeping customers satisfied (Bank for Canadian Entrepreneurs, N.D.; Glenn & Shyam, 2004).</p> 
                                              
                                              
                                            <p> As Acme Manufacturing is a SME and based on this report, COTS solution seems to satisfy 
                                              the company’s requirements and needs (see Appendix A). Although each solution is followed
                                              by risks, COTS offers adaptability, flexibility, potential technical upgradeability, and 
                                              integration of the latest technologies from the proposed framework (Anderson, 2021).</p>

                              <p>In unit 3, we were asked to read about Object-Oriented Development (Rumbaugh et at, 2003) and 
                              various Agile models (Abrahamsson, 2003). We also had to submit our team project assessing the
                              risks of the three ERP systems the assigned manufacturing company is looking to implement. We 
                              also had to continue our discussions in Unit 2.</p>
                              <p>I have enjoyed both papers from this unit. We have touched upon the object-oriented programming 
                              practices in the first module. The papers provide a good overview of this method's benefits. 
                              The paper on Agile was quite informative since it covered several different Agile practices.
                              We have also finalised our report due to be submitted this week as a team.</p>

                                <p>From the journal, the five overall causes of risk, as highlighted by the article 
                                  by Roy et al. (2015) and Hijazi et al. (2014) that I can deduce are; </p>
                                <p> 1.Technological - These are the project’s technical implementation risks. 
                                  Examples of this risk are risk introduced by the code, old legacy code, 
                                  technological debt, or selecting the wrong technology. </p>
                                <p>2.Operating - These are organisational risks, like downtime caused by
                                  unreasonable searches for specific specialists for project creation and poor 
                                  project management at the various phases of SDLC (Khdour et al., 2014). The 
                                  risk here can be classified as operational. </p>
                                <p> 3.Business - The risks faced by businesses are a combination of positive 
                                  and negative events that directly affect business growth and solvency. A company
                                  going bankrupt due to debt is an example. </p>
                                <p> 4.External - External risks can affect the business and, in turn, the project
                                  it is working on, positively or negatively. An example of such an external risk 
                                  is the recent pandemic, which is unprecedented and unpredictable. </p>
                                <p> 5.Improper management of changes - risks arising from relatively long stages 
                                  from one state of development to the other makes it difficult to estimate the time 
                                  cost and other resources needed to accomplish each stage efficiently. </p>

                              <p> Security is a crucial part of any application or environment (Bullock and Benford,

                                gets access to what? What are the rules? How is it tracked? These are managed through an
                                access control system providing access to restricted areas of the business (SailPoint,

                                Access control is governed according to the space within which subjects and objects

                              <p>Samuel, thanks for this interesting post on authentication and authorisation.

                                To add some insight.

                                Authentication and authorisation are multi-deployment security system that plays an
                                essential
                                role in securing systems, confirming identities and granting access. authentication and
                                authorisation are two of the most critical aspects of system control because providing a
                                secure
                                environment on the internet is a daunting task. (Saracino and Mori, 2020)

                                Authenticating the identity of users before authoring access to any data or applications
                                is
                                critical, which makes authorisation the second step after authentication. Supporting the
                                view
                                that authentication and authorisation can either permit or deny access to a system are
                                based
                                on
                                various criteria. In basic security service, and identity authentication is the first
                                and
                                the
                                most crucial defence line for vital information and network security mechanisms in every
                                society. (Wang et al., 2013).
                                however, when applied together, proof to be a powerful tool to successfully manage and
                                prevent
                                access to sensitive data in a cyber environment.

                                Most of the security operating systems in use today use Authentication and
                                authorisation,
                                which
                                is explained based on the privileges of the user. An example is the Discretionary access
                                control
                                system, which has the principle of access restriction, i.e. where the owner of the
                                system
                                determines who get access to the security system. (Lopez, Oppliger and Pernul, 2004)


                                Mandatory Access Control is among the most critical of secure access systems, allowing
                                access
                                based on clearance level, where users cannot make any change to the access rights. (Hu,
                                Kuhn
                                and
                                Yaga, 2017)</p>
                              <P>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts network access by implementing the principle
                                of
                                least
                                privilege. Only those permissions should be implied by roles required to carry out the
                                responsibilities of a job that performs an organisational function. (Lopez, Oppliger and
                                Pernul,
                                2004)</p>

                              <p> Hi, I agree with your post. Firstly, the importance of authentication and
                                authorisation
                                is
                                well documented. In 2020, the most common password was still 123456 (Fruhlinger &
                                Martin,
                                2021;
                                Whitney, 2020) which shows that the message still is not getting through. Users are not
                                protecting themselves adequately, and systems do not provide sufficient rules for
                                creating
                                secure passwords.
                                But is the onus on the system owners or the users themselves to ensure appropriate
                                standards
                                when authenticating? In many cases, the organisation will be required to put specific
                                standards
                                in place, however I believe that education for users, or at least uptake, is still also
                                lacking
                                and therefore more still needs to be done.

                                As you have alluded, a single mode of authentication may not be enough, and multifactor
                                authentication (using various types) in particular is a very good method of protecting
                                user
                                identity. In a digital world where almost anything can be spoofed, having multiple forms
                                of
                                authentication makes it exponentially more difficult to fake an identity, both when
                                carrying
                                out
                                transactions and authenticating to systems.
                                Artificial intelligence may well be the way forward, together with attribute-based
                                authentication which takes many factors into account during the authentication process.

                                In terms of authorisation, following the principle of least privilege, whereby a subject
                                is
                                only
                                given the minimum permissions or privileges to do any specific task, can protect against
                                malicious or accidental misuse, and help to limit the effects of advanced persistent
                                threats
                                (APT).

                              <p>I agree with your post, Samuel. As Richard pointed out, the most common password is
                                still
                                123456. It is clear that passwords create risk and in order for enterprises to truly
                                protect
                                their systems, apps, and data, all requests for access to corporate resources must
                                include
                                more
                                than just a user name and password. A key tenet of the Zero Trust model is strong access
                                management. Businesses may increase security and improve the user experience by
                                switching
                                to
                                a

                                passwordless
                                authentication and adaptive MFA. Secure access in Zero Trust Model would look like this:
                                Do I know the user?
                                Have I seen this device before?
                                Does the device meet our standards?
                                What is our risk tolerance?
                                Should we grant or deny access?
                                Adaptive MFA provides contextual information and can determine which authentication
                                factors
                                apply to a particular situation. Users may be required to only accept a push
                                notification
                                if

                                situation is deemed less risky, or maybe enter an SMS code also if the situation is
                                deemed
                                medium risky and altogether denied if the situation is deemed high risk.</p>

                              <p>Hi Samuel, this is an important security feature. Authentication and Authorization
                                require
                                Identification features. Passwords are a means of Identification provided mostly at the
                                application layer. Initially, password Identification would require a 4-digit numeric
                                number
                                but
                                nowadays, these are considered weak. Applications like the Google password Manager can
                                generate
                                strong passwords with a combination of numeric, alphanumeric and special characters.

                                There are also advance identification methods like biometric identification which
                                employs
                                user's
                                physical attributes like fingerprint, iris, retina, faces and voice. Advancements now
                                incorporate multibiometric schemes for user authentication (Luis-Garcia et al., 2003).

                                Authentication and Authorization will keep advancing depending on how the identification
                                features evolve. As you mentioned, identifying who someone is, has long passed username
                                and
                                passwords to more advanced Artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies. There
                                is
                                also
                                the multi-factor authentication, that is, verifying an individual identity based on two
                                to
                                three
                                different parameters, something you have, know and are. This can therefore be inferred
                                that
                                the
                                potential in this security feature, will not be exhausted anytime soon as long as there
                                are
                                unique and differing attributes in life. In my opinion, the challenge may only lie on
                                the
                                ability to integrate new identification features into Authorization and Authentication.

                        to
                        medical mannequin and mitigation.
                        Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                        vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                        helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                        researching the ways to mitigate the
                        threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                        has
                        allowed me to improve my research
                        and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                        The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                        which I personally found quite interesting
                        and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                        parts of the world with different time zone
                        and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                        do
                        believe it will be more challenging than
                        teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                        skills, but also time management, planning,
                        online meeting etiquette.
                        One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                        team worked well together and were able to
                        complete the contract efficiently.</p>
