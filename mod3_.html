                              </p>
                              <p>Cybercrime has propagated not just affected individual companies but has turned into a
                                societal (global) menace. For example, in April 2021the ransomware attack of the
                                colonial
                                pipeline affected energy availability on the East Coast of the United States, creating
                                disorder and confusion. As gasoline shortages directly impact most Ameri-cans, this
                                attack
                                hit close to homes. Safety rules were ignored as residents hoarded petroleum products(
                                inflammable) in plastic bags and bins; one car even caught fire. In addition, the
                                ransomware
                                targeted the billing system, and the internal business network, leading to widespread
                                shortages in multiple states. Colonial Pipeline even-tually paid the ransom of 4.4
                                million
                                dollars in bitcoin (Illinois, 2021).
                                Cyber-attacks cause companies very high reputation damage causing them to lose customers
                                to
                                their competitors because of loss of trust. It has been discovered that about 6%of
                                companies
                                affected by ransomware have paid ransom to regain control of their critical
                                infrastructure.
                                Businesses that come under cyber attack also incur higher costs from operational
                                disruption
                                and altered business practices. In addition, compa-nies that have experienced data
                                breaches
                                have paid millions to settle claims because of the obligation they owe to the customers
                                to
                                protect the information they collect ac-cording to laws like the GDPR.
                                “According to business insurers, Hiscox Companies lost $1.8 billion to cybercrime in
                                2019
                                as
                                a result of litigation” (Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2019, 2019).
                                Cybersecurity is not just critical to reducing the cost on companies when there is a
                                breach;
                                it also can cause chaos in society when necessary facilities are affected.

                              <p>1.In conjunction with these points, which you have highlighted, the importance of cyber
                                security in our society, small and large companies is enormous.
                                A good and comprehensive cyber security will protect the business and assure the
                                employees
                                that they are safe to work, resulting in the company's growth and society in general.
                                One of the most valuable commodities in the digital age is personal information. If
                                intruders can obtain personal information regarding your employees or customers, they
                                are
                                quite capable of selling that information or even using it for monetary gain.
                                Efficient cyber security will cause the productivity of a business to increase; as we
                                all
                                know, the attack on a system that has a virus will slow down the system to an almost
                                impossible rate to work. Adware in the form of a virus can be so annoying and slow down
                                the
                                productivity of an enterprise and can lead to the point of entry for malicious
                                activities.
                                The BBC reports that the outage of the Facebook website due to configuration cost
                                Facebook
                                more than $6bn (£4.4bn), with its shares dropping nearly 5%. This was only in some hours
                                of
                                disruption. Attacks on any website cost the business lots of money, reputational damage,
                                and
                                even the risk of bankruptcy.
                                Trust in a business is one of the most critical factors that drive the growth and
                                sustainability of the business. Once a company has a good reputation that its security
                                is
                                guaranteed and their privacy and data are in good hands, the public will eventually
                                build
                                trust in that company, and so will the growth of the business.
                                The importance of cybersecurity today is vital for the growth and proper functioning of
                                any
                                enterprise and organisation. It also creates jobs for humanity

                              <p> It is often complicated to apportion an adequate amount of security to an asset; this
                                makes the problem of securing an asset more cumbersome. Before the ages of recent
                                digitalisation, it was that simple that data were stored in cabinets and required just
                                physical security to keep them safe. Still, now it is not just physical security needed
                                to
                                secure the file server or the computer. There is also the need to have a cryptographer
                                to
                                encrypt passwords, well-trained personnel to handle and configure the system so it won’t
                                have vulnerabilities, a monitoring system to detect intruders etc. All these have made
                                the
                                security of the systems and cybercrime prevention more difficult, especially for small
                                companies. Cybercrimes are often carried out with the attacker in a different location
                                from
                                where the crime is being perpetuated is another difficult challenge to cyberspace
                                security.

                                technical side identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet level
                                has
                                improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyber-attacks to
                                individual
                                perpetrators, especially to states that direct the attacks, is complicated because it
                                involves unsettled legal and political issues.
                                Legal issues surrounding the attribution of state-sponsored cyber-attacks have received
                                comparatively little attention. A significant reason for this differential treatment may
                                be
                                the status of the relevant non–cyber specific international law. This has made the cyber
                                fight against actors more complicated and persistent in society.
                                Although all these challenges exist, the fight and importance of cyber security are
                                still
                                vital to the sustainability of business and societal growth. Thus, it has become a
                                societal
                                problem that needs to be addressed both by the company and the government.

                              <p>To add a little to the importance of cyber security in the health sector.
                                As a result of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cyberattack has increased dramatically,
                                affecting
                                the health care sector, as the world health organisation alerted. The number of
                                cyberattacks
                                is now more than five times what it used to be before the pandemic endangering the
                                health
                                care industry revealing a considerable risk for health processes. However, this risk
                                comes
                                from people actions, technology failure that results from cyber-attacks.
                                Some healthcare providers use IoT applications to provide critical medical services such
                                as
                                embedded context prediction, embedded gateway configuration; indirect emergency
                                treatment;
                                semantic medical access; wearable device access; health information regarding children,
                                community healthcare, and adverse drug reactions. Beneficiaries can receive these
                                services
                                using various medical IoT applications, such as healthcare solutions that use
                                smartphones,
                                wheelchair and medication management, rehabilitation systems, and systems to monitor
                                oxygen
                                saturation, body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiograms; and sensing blood
                                glucose level. These IoT applications can reduce medical services’ costs, improve the
                                users’
                                experiences and serve more patients with the limited availability of healthcare
                                resources.
                                (WIRED Staff, 2011) However, the attack on this IOT product will hamper and
                                significantly
                                affect primary health care services delivery.
                                Therefore, the importance of cybersecurity can never be overemphasised as much and
                                greater
                                need for the proper security of these IoT appliances.

                        <p>During unit 1 we had collaborative discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable
                          to
                          medical mannequin and mitigation.
                          Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                          vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                          helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                          researching the ways to mitigate the
                          threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                          has
                          allowed me to improve my research
                          and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                          The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                          which I personally found quite interesting
                          and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                          parts of the world with different time zone
                          and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                          do
                          believe it will be more challenging than
                          teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                          skills, but also time management, planning,
                          online meeting etiquette.
                          One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                          team worked well together and were able to
                          complete the contract efficiently.

                              </p>
                              <p>In the initial post, Tolofari, S. (2021) related how cyberattacks could significantly
                                affect society causing chaos and substantial financial and reputational loss to
                                companies. A
                                breach probably affects a company's infrastructure, like the Colonial Pipeline
                                ransomware
                                attack that affected energy availability and compromised the personal information of
                                nearly
                                6,000 individuals, creating disorder, confusion, and property loss(Business, 2021).
                                According to Danialou, M.(2021), on the peer response, we are already amid a "cyber
                                pandemic" with the number of attacks on critical infrastructures rising sharply.
                                It was also Highlighted that inadequate cyber security has led to substantial economic
                                loss
                                to companies through litigation and fines over data breaches and violations. For
                                example,
                                laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Intersoft Consulting, 2018)
                                fined
                                British Airways through the UK's data protection authority after customer data leakage
                                due
                                to poor data security. Equifax incurred almost 148 million due to compromised data
                                records
                                (Johnson, 2021). DigiNotar, a certificate authority, went bankrupt due to the control of
                                all
                                eight of the company's certificate-issuing servers pinpointing the unwavering need for
                                cyber
                                security (Fisher, D 2012).
                                The effect of cybercrime on healthcare industries in the initial post, Okafor-Tolofari,
                                I.
                                (2021), was extensively discussed. An example was the WannaCry Ransomware that cost the
                                NHS
                                £92 million in recovery. The evolution of medicine significantly depends on IoT devices
                                to
                                provide critical medical services. A cyber-attack that affects these facilities will
                                result
                                in the loss of life and jeopardy in society.
                                The covid pandemic that hit the world, as agreed with Jurbe. in the peer response, has
                                changed the way we work, with remote work and studies being the solution and an
                                alternative
                                to the pandemic (Jubet, 2021). Imagine a disruption of cyber activities, what
                                catastrophe
                                and chaos it will cause the world's economy, and its imbalance to society.
                                The need for having well-trained and staffed cybersecurity professionals in business,
                                government agencies cannot be overemphasised. A lack of it will significantly affect the
                                business economically, cause reputational loss, and create a volatile society.</p></br>

                      <p>During unit 1 we had collaborative discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable
                        to
                        medical mannequin and mitigation.
                        Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                        vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                        helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                        researching the ways to mitigate the
                        threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                        has
                        allowed me to improve my research
                        and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                        The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                        which I personally found quite interesting
                        and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                        parts of the world with different time zone
                        and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                        do
                        believe it will be more challenging than
                        teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                        skills, but also time management, planning,
                        online meeting etiquette.
                        One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                        team worked well together and were able to
                        complete the contract efficiently.

                              <p>Samuel, thanks for this interesting post on authentication and authorisation.

                                To add some insight.

                                Authentication and authorisation are multi-deployment security system that plays an
                                essential
                                role in securing systems, confirming identities and granting access. authentication and
                                authorisation are two of the most critical aspects of system control because providing a
                                secure
                                environment on the internet is a daunting task. (Saracino and Mori, 2020)

                                Authenticating the identity of users before authoring access to any data or applications
                                is
                                critical, which makes authorisation the second step after authentication. Supporting the
                                view
                                that authentication and authorisation can either permit or deny access to a system are
                                based
                                on
                                various criteria. In basic security service, and identity authentication is the first
                                and
                                the
                                most crucial defence line for vital information and network security mechanisms in every
                                society. (Wang et al., 2013).
                                however, when applied together, proof to be a powerful tool to successfully manage and
                                prevent
                                access to sensitive data in a cyber environment.

                                Most of the security operating systems in use today use Authentication and
                                authorisation,
                                which
                                is explained based on the privileges of the user. An example is the Discretionary access
                                control
                                system, which has the principle of access restriction, i.e. where the owner of the
                                system
                                determines who get access to the security system. (Lopez, Oppliger and Pernul, 2004)


                                Mandatory Access Control is among the most critical of secure access systems, allowing
                                access
                                based on clearance level, where users cannot make any change to the access rights. (Hu,
                                Kuhn
                                and
                                Yaga, 2017)</p>
                              <P>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts network access by implementing the principle
                                of
                                least
                                privilege. Only those permissions should be implied by roles required to carry out the
                                responsibilities of a job that performs an organisational function. (Lopez, Oppliger and
                                Pernul,

                                Whitney, 2020) which shows that the message still is not getting through. Users are not
                                protecting themselves adequately, and systems do not provide sufficient rules for
                                creating
                                secure passwords.
                                But is the onus on the system owners or the users themselves to ensure appropriate
                                standards
                                when authenticating? In many cases, the organisation will be required to put specific
                                standards
                                in place, however I believe that education for users, or at least uptake, is still also
                                lacking
                                and therefore more still needs to be done.

                                As you have alluded, a single mode of authentication may not be enough, and multifactor
                                authentication (using various types) in particular is a very good method of protecting
                                user
                                identity. In a digital world where almost anything can be spoofed, having multiple forms
                                of
                                authentication makes it exponentially more difficult to fake an identity, both when
                                carrying
                                out
                                transactions and authenticating to systems.
                                Artificial intelligence may well be the way forward, together with attribute-based
                                authentication which takes many factors into account during the authentication process.

                                In terms of authorisation, following the principle of least privilege, whereby a subject
                                is
                                only
                                given the minimum permissions or privileges to do any specific task, can protect against
                                malicious or accidental misuse, and help to limit the effects of advanced persistent
                                threats
                                (APT).

                              <p>I agree with your post, Samuel. As Richard pointed out, the most common password is
                                still
                                123456. It is clear that passwords create risk and in order for enterprises to truly
                                protect
                                their systems, apps, and data, all requests for access to corporate resources must
                                include
                                more
                                than just a user name and password. A key tenet of the Zero Trust model is strong access
                                management. Businesses may increase security and improve the user experience by
                                switching
                                to
                                a

                                authentication and adaptive MFA. Secure access in Zero Trust Model would look like this:
                                Do I know the user?
                                Have I seen this device before?
                                Does the device meet our standards?
                                What is our risk tolerance?
                                Should we grant or deny access?
                                Adaptive MFA provides contextual information and can determine which authentication
                                factors
                                apply to a particular situation. Users may be required to only accept a push
                                notification
                                if

                                situation is deemed less risky, or maybe enter an SMS code also if the situation is

                              <p>Hi Samuel, this is an important security feature. Authentication and Authorization
                                require
                                Identification features. Passwords are a means of Identification provided mostly at the
                                application layer. Initially, password Identification would require a 4-digit numeric
                                number
                                but
                                nowadays, these are considered weak. Applications like the Google password Manager can
                                generate
                                strong passwords with a combination of numeric, alphanumeric and special characters.

                                There are also advance identification methods like biometric identification which
                                employs
                                user's
                                physical attributes like fingerprint, iris, retina, faces and voice. Advancements now
                                incorporate multibiometric schemes for user authentication (Luis-Garcia et al., 2003).

                                Authentication and Authorization will keep advancing depending on how the identification
                                features evolve. As you mentioned, identifying who someone is, has long passed username
                                and
                                passwords to more advanced Artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies. There
                                is
                                also
                                the multi-factor authentication, that is, verifying an individual identity based on two
                                to
                                three
                                different parameters, something you have, know and are. This can therefore be inferred
                                that
                                the
                                potential in this security feature, will not be exhausted anytime soon as long as there
                                are
                                unique and differing attributes in life. In my opinion, the challenge may only lie on
                                the
                                ability to integrate new identification features into Authorization and Authentication.

                        to
                        medical mannequin and mitigation.
                        Since the unit learning outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats, risks and
                        vulnerabilities, this task has certainly
                        helped me apply the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecture cast into practice. I also enjoyed
                        researching the ways to mitigate the
                        threats discussed in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities, and I think the task
                        has
                        allowed me to improve my research
                        and information synthesis skills are also listed as one of the learning outcomes.
                        The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on teamwork,
                        which I personally found quite interesting
                        and challenging at the same time since my team is made of four, and we all reside in different
                        parts of the world with different time zone
                        and work schedule. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I
                        do
                        believe it will be more challenging than
                        teamwork, however, has the potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn teamwork
                        skills, but also time management, planning,
                        online meeting etiquette.
                        One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. most of the
                        team worked well together and were able to
                        complete the contract efficiently.</p>
