                        <p>In the first week of the information risk management module, we met our tutor,
                           talked about the upcoming assignments, and began learning about some of the 
                           fundamentals of risk management in terms of information security.			
                          The reading for this unit included the first three chapters of the Sutton
                           book on information risk management from 2021, the Hubbard book on risk management 
                           failure from 2009, and the NIST risk management guide from 2002. The book by
                            Hubbard is quite divisive. I don't think it's a bad idea for management teams 
                            at different companies to use the non-quantitative risk assessment approach. 
                            Insurance and finance companies, for example, frequently have a large amount 
                            of pre-existing data that can be used to calculate risk likelihood, impact,
                             cost, and so on. Small and medium-sized businesses, on the other hand, do not
                              have access to this information. Risk management must still be performed based 
                              on the best assumptions, which is why I believe those with low, medium, and high 
                              qualifications are valuable.		
                          The NIST publication was also very informative. This document provided very clear and 
                          informative risk management guidance that less experienced professionals implementing
                           risk management systems could easily follow. Hopefully, we can put this information 
                           to use during our team assignments.</p>

                          <h3>MY INITIAL POST</h3>
                          </p>
                          <p>The article's authors discussed whether user participation is necessary for security
                             risk management (SRM) using a qualitative and quantitative approach. The qualitative 
                             approach gathered information on the activities, behaviours, and assignments defining
                              user participation. They then used quantitative methods to assess the model.</p>

                            <p>User participation in SRM was found to raise organisational consciousness of security
                             risks and controls within targeted business processes and eased the greater alignment
                              of SRM with business objectives, values, and needs. User participation creates awareness
                               of security risks and controls within targeted business processes. As a result, the
                                development and performance of security controls will improve (Spears and Barki, 2010).</p>
                            
                              <p>IS security literature has often cited users as the weak link in IS security due to user 
                            errors and negligence. The present study provides empirical evidence that suggests otherwise.
                             User participation raises organisational awareness of security risks and controls within 
                             business processes. The need for regulatory compliance may encourage user participation 
                             in SRM. Security managers can use regulatory compliance to engage users, raise 
                             organisational awareness of security, and better align security measures with business 
                             objectives.</p>
                            <p>
                            To compensate for this lack of access, we will rely on case studies and other academic
                             sources to gather information as qualitative measures and then use the quantitative 
                             measures to analyse the collected data.</p>

                                <p>We are to read the Spears & Barki (2010) article, then discuss the following: </p>
                                  <p> 1. How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches?</p> 
                              <p>  What benefits did each approach yield?</p> 
                            <p>2.   What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk
                                  management process?</p> 
                            <p>3.  Based on the findings of the research,</p> 
                                  <p><li> How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out
                                  as part of your assessment?</li> </p>
                                <p> <li> Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods
                                  you utilise?</li>
                                <p> <li> How might you mitigate any issues encountered? </p></li>
                                <p>  These questions were answered in the initial post which is posted in the collaborative discussion 1.

                      <p>In unit 2, we have been asked to submit an initial collaborative discussion forum post and
                         to read up on the risk identification processes. We have started work on the unit 3 team assignment
                          document. </p>
		
                        <p> The collaborative discussion required us to read a paper on the user participation impact on
                         the Information Systems Security Risk Management (Spears & Barki, 2010) and to 	answer some
                          questions, such as providing details of the quantitative vs. qualitative research methods
                           used by the authors, their discoveries on how the users have a positive impact 	on the 
                           risk management processes, etc. Also, how do we think not having any users to work with
                            will impact our risk assessments we will have to complete?  </p>		
                          <p> I found the article interesting. Although the users provide very useful information required
                         to design good quality information security risk management policies and that the user
                          involvement may increase their awareness and willingness to follow these policies, in my
                           opinion, humans remain the weakest link in cybersecurity. </p> 		
                          <p>  Human errors are common in every industry. Stress at work, a lack of sleep, etc. can lead us
                         to make wrong decisions that in turn inadvertently breach security. It reduces the risk of
                          human-related vulnerabilities, but it does not remove them. </p>
                            
                        <p>  We also had to read a chapter in the book by Sutton (2021) on the risk identification process.
                         The author provided some very helpful tips on how to assess the identified risk impact, who 
                         should be involved in these assessments, as well as some helpful tips on how the semi-quantitative
                          impact assessment methods could be used.  </p>		
                        <p> The auhor has also highlighted that when assessing the impact, employee wellbeing impact should
                         also be considered, which, I have to say, I did not think about it. In my opinion, employee
                          wellbeing is a very important aspect of the risk assessment, and based on my not having thought
                           about it before, it made me wonder how many more professionals in the IT industry would only 
                           assess the impact by considering only the technical, operational, and user-related risk aspects. </p>
                            
                          <p> During the week, we also started working on our Unit 3 assignment and submitted our team contract.
                         It was a little harder to get started on this module since we were not allocated to our teams until 
                         the start of 2. However, everyone in our team had worked together before, and so getting into the 
                         rhythm wasn't too difficult. complicated. We made good progress on our assignment, which is coming 
                         up in the unit, and had a team meeting on Sunday to agree on what is left to complete on the assignment.

                                  <p>thank you for your initial discussion post. You have nicely summarised the paper by Spears and Barki (2010).
                                     However, I disagree with the statement that the authors have provided evidence proving the users are not the
                                      greatest information security risk. I agree with the paper: users can provide many benefits to the Security 
                                      Risk Management strategy and participation can reduce the Information security risks by improving the 
                                      user's buy-in into the security. However, I do not think that the users being the greatest risk and an 
                                      advantage are mutually exclusive: the user involvement can provide many benefits whilst the users will 
                                      continue being the greatest security risk. </p>

                                    <p> A report published by Tessian (2022) looked into why the human errors causing the data breaches happen in
                                     the first place and the reasons such as distractions and burnout were identified. The same company did a
                                      report in 2020 (Tessian) and the percentage of people who identified distractions as the main reason has 
                                      increased in 2022 report due to moving to the remote working settings. These reasons why the data breaches 
                                      happen is not something that can be eradicated by involving people in the Security Risk Management processes,
                                       in my opinion . </p>

                                    I cannot agree more that Humans are the weakest link in the security chain. 52% of businesses
                                    admit that employees are their biggest weakness in IT security, with their careless actions
                                    putting business IT security strategies at risk. More than 90% of cybersecurity issues 
                                    originate from human error within your organisation, not externally (Saylor Academy, 2021).  </p>
                                    
                                  <p> But in information security management, user participation in information systems security risk
                                    management and its influence in the context of regulatory compliance via a multi-method study 
                                    at the organisational level. Eleven informants across five organisations were interviewed to 
                                    understand the types of activities and security controls in which users participated as part 
                                    of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance on which research model was developed based on the qualitative 
                                    study findings and extant user participation theories in the systems development literature. 
                                    The research model supported the analysis of the data collected in a questionnaire survey of
                                    ISACA, a professional association specialising in information technology governance, audit, and
                                    security. Findings indicated that user participation contributed to improved security control 
                                    performance (Spears and Barki, 2010)  </p>
                                    
                                  <p> Risk assessment personnel can use a questionnaire to collect relevant information about the management
                                    and operational controls planned for the IT system. The questionnaire could also be used during on-site
                                    visits and interviews. Interviews with IT system support and management personnel can enable risk 
                                    assessment personnel to collect useful information (Stoneburner, Goguen and Feringa, 2002)

                                  <p>Regarding the two methods complementing each other, In quantitative analysis,
                                    risks are sorted by their financial impact, assets by their financial value, 
                                    and the result is expressed in a specific management terminology. The 
                                    evaluation and results are based on objective methods. In contrast, the 
                                    qualitative approach makes it easier to understand and observe the level 
                                    of risk, with the methods of calculation being simple and easy to implement.
                                    The frequency of occurrence of threats does not need to be quantified as the 
                                    monetary value of information is not determined, which makes the analysis 
                                    easier. Therefore quantitative calculations of frequency and impact are not 
                                    necessary.</p>
                                    
                                  <p> They both have their drawbacks. In the quantitative approach, the value of the 
                                    risk impact is based on the subjective opinion of the people involved. The 
                                    process takes a long time, and the results are presented only in monetary value
                                    and are hard to understand by people without experience. The process is complex.
                                    Unlike the qualitative approach, a cost-benefit analysis is not implemented, only 
                                    a subjective approach of the author, which makes it challenging to implement 
                                    controls. There is insufficient differentiation between major risks, and the 
                                    result depends on the quality of the management team.</p>

                                  Concerning two techniques supplementing one another, In quantitative examination, 
                                  chances are arranged by their monetary effect, resources by their monetary worth, 
                                  and the outcome is communicated in a particular administration phrasing. The 
                                  assessment and results depend on true strategies. Conversely, the subjective 
                                  methodology makes it more clear and notice the degree of hazard, with the strategies 
                                  for computation being basic and simple to carry out. The recurrence of event of
                                  dangers needn't bother with to be evaluated as the financial worth of still up in 
                                  the air, which makes the examination simpler. In this manner quantitative computations
                                  of recurrence and effect are excessive. The two of them have their disadvantages.
                                  In the quantitative methodology, the worth of the gamble influence depends on the 
                                  abstract assessment of individuals included. The cycle consumes a large chunk of the
                                  day, and the outcomes are introduced exclusively in financial worth and are difficult
                                  to comprehend by individuals without experience. The cycle is intricate. Not at all 
                                  like the subjective methodology, a money saving advantage examination isn't carried 
                                  out, just an emotional methodology of the creator, which makes it trying to execute 
                                  controls. There is inadequate separation between significant dangers, and the outcome
                                  relies upon the nature of the supervisory group. </p>

                                        and supply constant maintenance and support for IT-based systems (Karimi et. al., 2007).

                                              <p>This report evaluates the three ERP solutions; commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), open-source,
                                              and in-house, based on key elements in the framework, including the involvement of 
                                              organisational levels, critical success factors, implementation methodology and process,
                                              and relevant risks. COTS solutions are considered to be more suitable for SMEs and easier 
                                              to manage, as well as projects to replace the company's deprecated systems, making them more
                                              efficient, and keeping customers satisfied (Bank for Canadian Entrepreneurs, N.D.; Glenn & Shyam, 2004).</p> 
                                              
                                              
                                            <p> As Acme Manufacturing is a SME and based on this report, COTS solution seems to satisfy 
                                              the company’s requirements and needs (see Appendix A). Although each solution is followed
                                              by risks, COTS offers adaptability, flexibility, potential technical upgradeability, and 
                                              integration of the latest technologies from the proposed framework (Anderson, 2021).</p>

                              <p>In unit 3, we were asked to read about Object-Oriented Development (Rumbaugh et at, 2003) and 
                              various Agile models (Abrahamsson, 2003). We also had to submit our team project assessing the
                              risks of the three ERP systems the assigned manufacturing company is looking to implement. We 
                              also had to continue our discussions in Unit 2.</p>
                              <p>I have enjoyed both papers from this unit. We have touched upon the object-oriented programming 
                              practices in the first module. The papers provide a good overview of this method's benefits. 
                              The paper on Agile was quite informative since it covered several different Agile practices.
                              We have also finalised our report due to be submitted this week as a team.</p>

                                <p>From the journal, the five overall causes of risk, as highlighted by the article 
                                  by Roy et al. (2015) and Hijazi et al. (2014) that I can deduce are; </p>
                                <p> 1.Technological - These are the project’s technical implementation risks. 
                                  Examples of this risk are risk introduced by the code, old legacy code, 
                                  technological debt, or selecting the wrong technology. </p>
                                <p>2.Operating - These are organisational risks, like downtime caused by
                                  unreasonable searches for specific specialists for project creation and poor 
                                  project management at the various phases of SDLC (Khdour et al., 2014). The 
                                  risk here can be classified as operational. </p>
                                <p> 3.Business - The risks faced by businesses are a combination of positive 
                                  and negative events that directly affect business growth and solvency. A company
                                  going bankrupt due to debt is an example. </p>
                                <p> 4.External - External risks can affect the business and, in turn, the project
                                  it is working on, positively or negatively. An example of such an external risk 
                                  is the recent pandemic, which is unprecedented and unpredictable. </p>
                                <p> 5.Improper management of changes - risks arising from relatively long stages 
                                  from one state of development to the other makes it difficult to estimate the time 
                                  cost and other resources needed to accomplish each stage efficiently. </p>

                      <p>As we continue on with this week's reading, we're focusing on the risks associated
                      with software development lifecycles. As a result of the two papers by Hijazi et
                      al. (2014) and Roy et al. (2015), a very detailed overview of the range of risks
                      that are associated with each stage of the software development life cycle.
                      During a risk assessment, the papers reviewed the overall risk categories that should
                      be used to ensure no specific type of risk is overlooked. </p>		
                    <p> The papers do provide useful guidance and could be used to assess the risks associated 
                      with any new software development. Both authors' ideas are similar in that they discuss
                      the need to address the risks specific to each software development stage rather than
                      an overall risk in order to ensure that all types of risks are examined.</p>

                              <p>How can we accurately represent and account for uncertainties in a way that properly justifies confidence in the risk results?

                              <h3>MY ANSWER</h3>
                              </p>
                              <p>Uncertainty is a key concept in risk conceptualisation and risk assessments. 
                                Probabilistic analysis is the predominant method used to handle the uncertainties
                                involved in risk analysis, both aleatory (representing variation) and epistemic 
                                (due to lack of knowledge). Flage et al. (2014) examines the problem and identify
                                foundational issues for its treatment. If subjective probabilities are used to 
                                express the uncertainties, we also need to reflect on the knowledge that supports
                                the probabilities. The NUSAP system (NUSAP: Numeral, Unit, Spread, Assessment, and Pedigree)
                                was initially designed for the analysis and diagnosis of uncertainty in science
                                for policy by performing a critical appraisal of the knowledge base behind the
                                relevant scientific information.</p>
                                <p>For example, Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1990, Kloprogge, 2005, Laes and Laes, 2011, van 
                                der Sluijs, and Spiegelhalter and Riesch provide forms of expression of uncertainty
                                within five levels: event, parameter and model uncertainty –. For interval probabilities,
                                it is important to consider the background knowledge and strength of this knowledge.
                                For situations characterised by large and "deep" uncertainties, there seems to be
                                broad acceptance of the need to see beyond probability. The combination of probability
                                and qualitative approaches represents an interesting alternative research direction.
                                A central area of uncertainty in risk assessment is uncertainty importance analysis (Aven, 2016)</p>
                                <p>Models play an important role in risk assessments, and considerable attention has been 
                                devoted to the issue of model uncertainty. The challenge is to identify what are the 
                                most critical and essential contributors to output uncertainties and risk. According
                                to Aven and Zio (2013), model uncertainty is interpreted as uncertainty about the 
                                model error, defined by g(x) – y, where y is the quantity, we would like to assess 
                                and g(x) is a model of y having some parameters x. Nevertheless, there has been some
                                lack of clarity in the risk field regarding what this concept means.</p>

                        associated risk management (Ridley et al., 2018; Varshney & Alemzadeh, 2017), 
                        papers on Disaster Recovery planning (Alhazmi & Malaiya, 2013),  a paper on 
                        the reputational risk management (Pineiro-Chousa et al., 2017) as well as a
                        paper on the optimal risk management framework selection (Marks, 2019).</p>
                        
                      <p> There is a need to revisit the information risk and overall risk assessment 
                        strategies of projects concerned with machine learning. As demonstrated in 
                        the articles, we often cannot predict every possible chance, which raises the
                        question of whether we should fully automate specific tasks. There are also 
                        interesting points on selecting the risk management framework and that what 
                        works for one company often does not for the other.</p>
                      <p> The paper by Marks (2019) was also helpful, siting the usefulness of preparing 
                        a risk register that contains every risk stating that it is more productive 
                        having a smaller list of risks and prioritising those risk mitigation that is 
                        higher on the list.

                              <p> The 5 Hard Problems were developed by the Principal Investigators (PIs)
                                of the Science of Security Lablets in collaboration with NSA Research 
                                to establish the beginnings of a common language and gauge progress.
                                They were chosen for their technical difficulty, potential operational
                                significance, and the likelihood of benefiting from a focus on 
                                scientific research methods and improved measurement capabilities. The 
                                five are not intended to be all-inclusive of everything that needs to
                                be done in cybersecurity but rather five specific areas that need 
                                scientific progress (AdamT, 2015).</p> 
                                <p> Scalability and Composability: create methods for building secure systems
                                with known security properties from components with known security 
                                properties without having to re-analyze the constituent elements completely.</p> 
                                
                                <p> Policy-Governed Secure Collaboration: Create methods for expressing and 
                                enforcing normative requirements and policies for handling data with
                                varying usage needs and among users with different levels of authority.</p> 
                                <p> Security Metrics Driven Evaluation, Design, Development, and Deployment: Create 
                                security metrics and models capable of predicting or confirming whether a given 
                                cyber system retains a given set of security properties (deterministically or
                                probabilistically) in a given context.</p> 
                                <p> Resilient Architectures: Create methods for designing and analyzing system 
                                architectures that provide required service in the face of compromised components.
                                Understanding.</p> 
                                <p> Accounting for Human Behavior: Create models of human behaviour (both users and
                                adversaries) that allow for the design, modeling, and analysis of systems with
                                specific security properties (AdamT, 2015).</p> 
                                <p> Information Risk management is concerned with the identification, evaluation,
                                and prioritisation of risks (defined in ISO 31000 as the effect of uncertainty 
                                on objectives) followed by coordinated and economical application of resources
                                to minimise, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events 
                                or to maximise the realisation of opportunities (Blakley, McDermott and Geer, 2001).</p> 
                                <p> The five challenging problems collaboratively were chosen for their technical 
                                difficulty, potential operational significance, and the likelihood of benefiting 
                                from a focus on scientific research methods and improved measurement capabilities 
                                in responding to this information risk management and as individually they are not
                                all-inclusive. Hence, every one of them involves the use of information risk management.</p>

                                In Unit One, the fundamentals of risk management regarding information security,
                                the various definitions of risk, assessment, qualification and mitigate risks.
                                The reading for this unit included the first three chapters of the Sutton book 
                                on information risk management, addressing approaches to quantify and qualify 
                                risks. The NIST publication provided unequivocal and informative risk management 
                                guidance and listed common risk standards and the appropriate one(s) for a given
                                situation.</p>
                                
                                <p> In unit two, we read a paper on the user participation impact on information 
                                systems security risk management (Spears & Barki, 2010), revamping my knowledge
                                of the differences between assessment approaches (qualitative vs quantitative).
                                I found the article interesting, highlighting human errors as common in every 
                                industry, reducing the risk of human-related vulnerabilities but does not eliminate
                                them.
                                During the week, we started working on our Unit 3 assignment and submitted our
                                team contract.</p>
                                
                                <p> We read a chapter in Sutton (2021) on the risk identification process, that provided
                                some constructive tips on assessing the identified risk impact.
                                In Unit three, we read about Object-Oriented Development (Rumbaugh et al., 2003),
                                various Agile models, and how risks affect the SDLC. We also had to submit our 
                                team project assessing the risks of the three ERP systems. The papers provide a 
                                good overview of this method's benefits and how to mitigate risks in a selected SDLC
                                methodology.</p>
                                
                                <p> In unit four, two papers by Hijazi et al. (2014) and Roy (2015) focus on the risks 
                                associated with software development lifecycles. The papers provide a very detailed
                                overview of the risks associated with each stage of the software development process.
                                Both authors' ideas are similar in discussing the need to address the risks specific
                                to each software development stage and propose mitigations for the most common risk.</p>
                                
                                <p> This unit reading included a chapter from the book by Sutton on how to produce the

                                challenging problems developed by the Principal Investigators (PIs) of the Science 
                                of Security Lablets in collaboration with NSA Research to establish the beginnings
                                of a common language and gauge progress (Adam, 2015), which include Scalability and
                                Composability, Policy-Governed Secure Collaboration, Security Metrics Driven 
                                Evaluation, Design, Development, and Deployment, Resilient Architectures and 
                                Accounting for Human Behaviour. This highlighted the technical difficulty, potential
                                operational significance, and the likelihood of benefiting from a focus on scientific
                                research methods and improved measurement capabilities. The paper demonstrated that 
                                the five problems are not intended to be all-inclusive of everything that needs to be
                                done in cybersecurity but rather five specific areas that need scientific progress 
                                (AdamT, 2015). The knowledge gained in the major trends driving the future of IRM was
                                broadly interesting.</p>
